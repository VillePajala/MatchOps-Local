## How to Push (Manual Step Required)

Git authentication isn't available in the Claude Code environment, so you need to push manually from your terminal.

### Option 1: Using Your Terminal (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /home/villepajala/projects/MatchOps-Local

# Verify you're on the correct branch
git branch
# Should show: * feat/indexeddb-complete-implementation

# Check commits are ready
git log --oneline -3
# Should show the 3 commits above

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feat/indexeddb-complete-implementation
```

### Option 2: Using Git CLI with Credentials

If you need to authenticate:

```bash
# For HTTPS (will prompt for username/password or token)
git push origin feat/indexeddb-complete-implementation

# For SSH (requires SSH key setup)
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:VillePajala/MatchOps-Local.git
git push origin feat/indexeddb-complete-implementation
```

### GitHub Personal Access Token (if needed)

If using HTTPS and password authentication fails, you'll need a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
4. Copy the token
5. Use token as password when pushing:
   ```bash
   Username: VillePajala
   Password: <paste-your-token-here>
   ```

## After Pushing - Testing Steps

Once pushed, test the fixes:

### Test 1: Silent Auto-Save (Toast Fix)
1. Start the app: `npm run dev`
2. Create a new game with season/team
3. **Expected**: ✅ No toasts appear
4. Log 2-3 goals
5. **Expected**: ✅ No toasts appear (but goals are saved)
6. Click manual "Save" button
7. **Expected**: ✅ One toast appears ("Game saved!")

### Test 2: Score Updates (React Query Fix)
1. With a game loaded, log a goal (score becomes 1-0)
2. Open saved games list (Load Game button)
3. **Expected**: ✅ Current game shows "1-0" (not "0-0")
4. Log another goal (score becomes 2-0)
5. Refresh the saved games list
6. **Expected**: ✅ Current game shows "2-0"

## Verification Commands

Before pushing, you can verify everything is ready:

```bash
# Check build passes
npm run build

# Check linting passes
npm run lint

# Check TypeScript passes
npx tsc --noEmit

# Check tests pass
npm test

# View commits to be pushed
git log origin/feat/indexeddb-complete-implementation..HEAD --oneline

# Check current branch
git status
```

All should pass ✅

## If Push Fails

### Error: "Authentication failed"
- Use Personal Access Token instead of password
- Or set up SSH key: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

### Error: "Permission denied"
- Check you have write access to the repository
- Verify remote URL: `git remote -v`

### Error: "Updates were rejected"
- Pull latest changes first: `git pull origin feat/indexeddb-complete-implementation`
- Then push: `git push origin feat/indexeddb-complete-implementation`

---

## Summary

**Current Status**: ✅ All fixes committed locally, ready to push

**Action Required**: Run `git push` from your terminal

**Expected Result**: 3 commits pushed to GitHub on branch `feat/indexeddb-complete-implementation`

**Next Steps**: Test the fixes in your browser to verify everything works as expected
