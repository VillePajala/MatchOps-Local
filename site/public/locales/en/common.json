      "a2": "All data is stored locally on your device in IndexedDB (browser storage). Nothing is sent to external servers.",
      "q3": "Can I use it on multiple devices?",
      "a3": "Yes, but you'll need to export your data from one device and import it on another. There's no automatic syncing since everything is stored locally.",
      "q4": "How do I back up my data?",
      "a4": "Open the Settings menu and use the Export function. This creates a JSON file with all your data that you can save and import later.",
      "q5": "Can I edit game data after it's recorded?",
      "a5": "Yes. You can edit, add, or delete goal events and modify match details. Just open the game from your history and make corrections.",
      "q6": "What happens if I lose my phone or it breaks?",
      "a6": "If you've made regular exports (backups), you can import your data on a new device. Without backups, data is lost with the device.",
      "q7": "Can I manage multiple teams?",
      "a7": "Yes. You can create and manage multiple teams (U12, U14, etc.) from the same app and switch between them easily.",
      "q8": "How much storage space does the app use?",
      "a8": "The app uses your device's free storage space through IndexedDB. Available space depends on your device and can be tens or even hundreds of gigabytes. Typical usage with 100+ games and full statistics is under 50MB.",
      "q9": "How do I update the app?",
      "a9": "The app updates automatically when you open it and have an internet connection. After an update, the app will notify you of the new version and ask you to reload the page.",
      "q10": "Can I share statistics with other coaches?",
      "a10": "Yes. You can export statistics in Excel or JSON format and share the files with other coaches via email or messaging apps."
