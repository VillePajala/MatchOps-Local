      "q3": "Can I use it on multiple devices?",
      "a3": "Yes, but you'll need to export your data from one device and import it on another. There's no automatic syncing since everything is stored locally.",
      "q4": "How do I back up my data?",
      "a4": "Open the Settings menu and use the Export function. This creates a JSON file with all your data that you can save and import later.",
      "q5": "Can I edit game data after it's recorded?",
      "a5": "Yes. You can edit, add or delete goal events, and edit match details. Just open the game from your history and make corrections.",
      "q6": "What happens if I lose my phone or it breaks?",
      "a6": "If you've made regular exports (backups), you can import your data on a new device. Without backups, data is lost with the device.",
      "q7": "Can I manage multiple teams?",
      "a7": "Yes. You can create and manage multiple teams (U12, U14, etc.) from the same app and switch between them easily.",
      "q8": "How much storage space does the app use?",
      "a8": "The app uses your device's free storage space through IndexedDB. Available space depends on your device and can be tens or even hundreds of gigabytes. Typical usage with 100+ games and full statistics is under 50MB."
