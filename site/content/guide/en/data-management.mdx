Your data in MatchOps is stored securely. This guide covers the storage options available and how to protect and manage your valuable match data.

## Data Storage Options

MatchOps offers two ways to store your data. You choose your preferred mode when first opening the app.

### Local Mode (No Account)

Store all data on your device only:

- **No account required** - Start using immediately
- **Works completely offline** - No internet needed
- **Data stays on device** - Maximum privacy
- **Single device only** - Data doesn't sync between devices

<Callout type="info">
Local mode is ideal for coaches who use a single device and prefer keeping data completely private.
</Callout>

### Cloud Mode (Account Required)

Store data in the cloud with automatic sync:

- **Account required** - Sign up with email and password
- **Sync across devices** - Access data from any device
- **Automatic backup** - Data stored securely in the cloud
- **Works offline** - Changes save locally, sync when online

<Callout type="info">
Cloud mode is ideal for coaches who use multiple devices or want automatic backup protection.
</Callout>

### Choosing Your Mode

When you first open MatchOps, you'll see the Welcome Screen with two options:

1. **Continue with Cloud** - Create an account or sign in for cross-device sync
2. **Continue Locally** - Start immediately with device-only storage

You can change your mode later in Settings.

</Callout>

## Sync Status

*This section applies to Cloud Mode users only.*

### Understanding Sync Indicators

When using cloud mode, you'll see sync status indicators:

- **Synced** - All changes saved to cloud
- **Syncing** - Upload in progress
- **Pending** - Changes waiting to sync
- **Offline** - No connection, changes saved locally

### Offline Behavior

Cloud mode works offline:

1. Changes save to your device immediately
2. When you reconnect, changes sync automatically
3. No data is lost during offline periods

<Callout type="tip">
You can use the app normally even without internet. Go to a game, track everything, and it will sync when you're back online.
</Callout>

### Sync Troubleshooting

If sync seems stuck:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Wait a few moments for retry
3. Try closing and reopening the app
4. Sign out and sign back in as last resort

## Backup

### Why Backup?

Even with cloud sync, manual backups are valuable:

- **Extra protection** - Belt and suspenders approach
- **Point-in-time snapshots** - Restore to specific dates
- **Transferable** - Share data with others
- **Works in both modes** - Local and cloud users benefit

### Creating a Backup

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Backup & Restore">
Open the menu (☰) and select **Backup & Restore**.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Export All">
Choose to export all your data.
</Step>

<Step title="Save the File">
Save the backup file to a secure location.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Backup File Format

Backups are saved as JSON files containing:

- All roster data
- Complete game history
- Season/tournament information
- App settings

### Backup Best Practices

1. **Regular backups** - Weekly or after important games
2. **Multiple locations** - Save to cloud storage (Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox)
3. **Before updates** - Backup before app or device updates
4. **Before device changes** - Essential when switching devices

<Callout type="info">
Cloud mode users: Your data is automatically backed up to the cloud, but manual backups give you additional protection and flexibility.
</Callout>

- Delete exports after sharing

## Storage Management

### Checking Storage

View your storage usage in the Settings modal (About section):

- **Storage Usage** - Shows used space vs. available quota (e.g., "45 MB of 50 MB")
- Visual progress bar indicating percentage used

### App Settings

The Settings modal provides:

- **Language** - Switch between English and Finnish
- **Default Team Name** - Pre-fill your team name for new games
- **Season Period** - Customize season start/end dates (default: October-May)
- **Account** (cloud mode) - View account info and sign out

### Clearing Data

If you need to clear data:

- **Clear old seasons** - Remove completed, archived seasons
- **Delete old games** - Remove individual games
- **Re-sync from cloud** (cloud mode) - Clear local cache and re-download from cloud
- **Factory reset** (cloud mode) - Clear all data including cloud storage
- **Hard reset** (local mode) - Clear all local data

<Callout type="tip">
Archive rather than delete when possible. Storage space is rarely a limiting factor.
</Callout>
