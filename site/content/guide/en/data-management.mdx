Your data in MatchOps Local is stored locally on your device. This guide covers how to protect and manage your valuable match data.

## How Data is Stored

### Local Storage

MatchOps Local uses IndexedDB, a browser database that:

- Stores data directly on your device
- Works offline
- Persists across sessions
- Has no cloud backup by default

<Callout type="warning">
Your data exists only on your device. If you uninstall the app, clear browser data, or lose your device, the data is gone unless you've backed it up.
</Callout>

### What's Stored

Your local database contains:

- Player roster and assessments
- All games and events
- Seasons and tournaments
- Teams and personnel
- User preferences and settings

### Backup File Format

Backups are saved as JSON files containing:

- All roster data

### Backup Best Practices

1. **Regular backups** - Weekly or after important games

Restoring from backup will replace your current data. Make sure to backup current data first if needed.
</Callout>

1. Create a full backup on old device

## Storage Management

### Checking Storage

View your storage usage:

<Callout type="tip">
Archive rather than delete when possible. Storage space is rarely a limiting factor.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting Data Issues

If data isn't persisting:

1. Check that you're not in private/incognito mode
2. Ensure browser allows storage
3. Try restarting the app
4. Check available device storage

### Corrupted Data

If data appears corrupted:

1. Try refreshing the app
2. Restore from a recent backup
