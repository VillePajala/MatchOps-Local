Your data in MatchOps Local is stored locally on your device. This guide covers how to protect and manage your valuable match data.

## How Data is Stored

### Device Storage

MatchOps Local stores data on your device's storage (disk). This means:

- Data persists even when you close the app or restart your device
- Works completely offline
- No cloud backup by default

<Callout type="warning">
Your data exists only on your device's storage. If you uninstall the app, clear app data in Android settings, or lose your device, the data is gone unless you've backed it up.
</Callout>

### What's Stored

Your local database contains:

- Player roster and assessments
- All games and events
- Seasons and tournaments
- Teams and personnel
- User preferences and settings

## Storage Management

### Checking Storage

View your storage usage in the Settings modal (About section):

- **Storage Usage** - Shows used space vs. available quota (e.g., "45 MB of 50 MB")
- Visual progress bar indicating percentage used

### App Settings

The Settings modal also provides:

- **Language** - Switch between English and Finnish

If you need to clear data:

- **Clear old seasons** - Remove completed, archived seasons
- **Delete old games** - Remove individual games
- **Full reset** - Clear all data (use with caution)

<Callout type="tip">
Archive rather than delete when possible. Storage space is rarely a limiting factor.
