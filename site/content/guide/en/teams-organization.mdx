MatchOps Local helps you organize your coaching activities across multiple teams, seasons, and tournaments.

## Managing Teams

### Creating Teams

Teams in MatchOps Local represent your squads. Create a team for each group you coach:

1. Click **Game Settings** in the control bar
2. Navigate to the **Teams** section
3. Click **Add Team** to create a new team
4. Enter the team name

### Multiple Teams

If you coach multiple teams (e.g., U12 and U14), each team can have:

- Its own roster
- Separate game history
- Individual statistics

## Personnel Management

Track your coaching staff and team personnel:

1. Access **Personnel** from the game settings
2. Add coaches, assistants, and team managers
3. Personnel appear in game reports and exports

## Seasons

### What is a Season?

A season represents a competitive period (e.g., "Spring 2025" or "Fall League 2024"). Seasons help you:

- Group related games together
- Track standings and statistics over time
- Compare performance across seasons

### Creating a Season

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to Seasons">
Navigate to the seasons section from the main menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Create New">
Tap **New Season** and enter:
- Season name
- Start and end dates
- Team association
</Step>

<Step title="Configure">
Set any additional options like game format defaults.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Linking Games to Seasons

When creating a new game, you can associate it with an active season. This:

- Adds the game to the season's record
- Updates season statistics automatically
- Includes it in season reports

## Tournaments

### Creating Tournaments

For cups, festivals, or single-event competitions:

1. Open **Game Settings**
2. Navigate to the **Tournaments** section
3. Click **Add Tournament**
4. Enter tournament name and dates

### Tournament Games

When you create a game, you can link it to a tournament instead of a season. Tournament games:

- Are grouped separately from season games
- Have their own statistics tracking
- Perfect for one-off events like cups or festivals

## Organization Tips

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, consistent names:

- ✅ "EKK U12 Spring 2025"
- ✅ "City Cup Tournament 2025"
- ❌ "my team games"

### Archiving

At the end of a season:

1. Review final statistics
2. Export any needed reports
3. The season becomes read-only
4. Historical data remains accessible

### Data Relationships

Understanding how data connects:

```
Team
├── Roster (players)
├── Seasons
│   └── Games
└── Tournaments
    └── Games
```

Games can exist:
- In a season
- In a tournament
- As standalone friendlies

## Best Practices

1. **Create seasons before games** - easier to organize
2. **Use descriptive names** - you'll thank yourself later
3. **Archive completed seasons** - keeps the interface clean
4. **Regular backups** - protect your organizational data
