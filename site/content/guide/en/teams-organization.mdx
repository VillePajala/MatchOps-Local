MatchOps helps you organize your coaching activities across multiple teams, seasons, and tournaments. This guide covers how to set up and manage your organizational data.

## Club Season Period

The app automatically calculates a club season period (e.g., "24/25") that is displayed with competition names. This helps organize data by playing year.

<Callout type="warning">
Configure the club season period in **Settings** before creating competitions. This affects how seasons and tournaments are named and grouped.
</Callout>

- The period is calculated from competition start dates
- Default is October-May if not configured
- Example: A season starting in November 2024 gets "24/25" added to its display name

See [Recommended Workflow](/guide/full-setup-path) for the complete setup process.

## Competitions

Competitions are either **Seasons** (for league play) or **Tournaments** (for cups and events).

### Seasons

A season represents a competitive period (e.g., "Spring 2025" or "Fall League 2024"). Seasons help you:

- Group related games together
- Track standings and statistics over time
- Compare performance across seasons

#### Creating a Season

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Seasons">
Open the menu (☰) and select **Seasons**.
</Step>

<Step title="Create New Season">
Click **New Season** and enter the required information.

Tournaments are for cups, festivals, or single-event competitions.

<Step title="Open Tournaments">
Open the menu (☰) and select **Tournaments**.

#### Tournament Series

Large tournaments often have multiple competition levels. Add series to organize them:

- **Haaste** - Challenge level
- **Harraste** - Recreational level

Each series can have its own games and standings within the same tournament.

<Callout type="tip">
Use tournament series when your team plays in a multi-level cup where different teams compete at different levels.
</Callout>

#### Tournament Awards

- **Player of Tournament** - Award recognition 🏆

#### Linking Games to Tournaments

When creating a game, you can link it to a tournament and optionally a specific series. Tournament games:

- Are grouped separately from season games
- Have their own statistics tracking
- Can be assigned to a specific series level

Teams represent your squads. Create a team for each group you coach.

### Creating Teams

1. Open the menu (☰) and select **My Teams**
2. Click **New Team**
3. Enter the team name
4. Link to a competition (optional but recommended)

### Linking Teams to Competitions

When you link a team to a season or tournament:

- Competition details auto-fill when creating games
- Statistics are tracked per competition
- Easy filtering in reports

### Multiple Teams

If you coach multiple teams (e.g., U12 and U14), each team can have:

- Its own roster
- Separate game history
- Individual statistics

<Callout type="tip">
When creating a game, select the appropriate team to keep your data organized.

### Team Placements

When editing a team, you can record final standings for competitions where the team has played:

1. Open **My Teams** and edit a team

## Tips and Best Practices

### Recommended Setup Order

Follow this order for best results:

1. Configure club season period in Settings
2. Create seasons and tournaments
3. Create teams and link to competitions
4. Add personnel

### Naming Conventions

**Team names** should be simple - typically based on club colors or simple identifiers:
- ✅ "PePo Lila"
- ✅ "PePo Violetti"
- ✅ "KuPS Hirvet"

The app automatically shows context in parentheses when needed (e.g., "PePo Lila (Spring League 24/25)"), so you don't need to add age groups or years to team names.

**Competition names** should be descriptive but without the club season period - it's added automatically:
- ✅ "Spring League" → displays as "Spring League 24/25"
- ✅ "Helsinki Cup" → displays as "Helsinki Cup 24/25"
- ❌ "Spring League 24/25" (redundant - period is added automatically)

### Archiving

At the end of a season or tournament:

1. Review final statistics
2. Export any needed reports
3. Archive the competition
4. Historical data remains accessible

### Regular Backups

Protect your organizational data with regular backups. See [Data Management](/guide/data-management) for backup instructions.
