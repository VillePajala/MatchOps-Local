## Seasons

### What is a Season?

A season represents a competitive period (e.g., "Spring 2025" or "Fall League 2024"). Seasons help you:

- Group related games together
- Track standings and statistics over time
- Compare performance across seasons

### Creating a Season

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Competitions">
Open the menu (☰) and select **Competitions**.
</Step>

<Step title="Create New Season">
Click **New Season** and enter the required information.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure">
Set game format defaults and other options.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Season Fields

When creating or editing a season:

- **Name** - Descriptive name (e.g., "Spring League 2025")
- **Location** - Where games are typically played
- **Age Group** - U7 through U21
- **Game Type** - Soccer or Futsal
- **Gender** - Boys or Girls
- **Period Settings** - Number of periods (1 or 2) and duration
- **Start/End Dates** - Season timeframe
- **League** - Finnish youth leagues (SM-sarja, Harrastesarja, etc.) or custom
- **Color Badge** - Visual identifier
- **Notes** - Additional information

### Club Season Label

The app automatically calculates the club season (e.g., "24/25") based on the Finnish football calendar (October-May). This helps organize data by playing year.

### Team Placements

Track final standings with placement badges:
- 🥇 First place
- 🥈 Second place
- 🥉 Third place

### Linking Games to Seasons

When creating a new game, you can associate it with an active season. This:

- Adds the game to the season's record
- Updates season statistics automatically
- Includes it in season reports

## Tournaments

### Creating Tournaments

For cups, festivals, or single-event competitions:

1. Open the menu (☰) and select **Competitions**
2. Switch to the Tournaments tab
3. Click **Add Tournament**
4. Enter tournament details

### Tournament Fields

Similar to seasons, but with additional options:

- **Name** - Tournament name
- **Location** - Venue
- **Dates** - Start and end dates
- **Age Group, Game Type, Gender** - Same as seasons
- **Period Settings** - Default game format
- **Player of Tournament** - Award recognition 🏆
- **Team Placements** - Final standings (🥇🥈🥉)

### Tournament Series

Large tournaments often have multiple competition levels. MatchOps Local supports **Tournament Series**:

- **Elite** - Top competitive level
- **Kilpa** - Competitive level
- **Haaste** - Challenge level
- **Harraste** - Recreational level

Each series can have its own games and standings within the same tournament.

<Callout type="tip">
Use tournament series when your team plays in a multi-level cup where different teams compete at different levels.
</Callout>

### Tournament Games

When you create a game, you can link it to a tournament (and optionally a specific series). Tournament games:

- Are grouped separately from season games
- Have their own statistics tracking
- Can be assigned to a specific series level
- Perfect for one-off events like cups or festivals

## Organization Tips

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, consistent names:

- ✅ "EKK U12 Spring 2025"
- ✅ "City Cup Tournament 2025"
- ❌ "my team games"

### Archiving

At the end of a season:

1. Review final statistics
2. Export any needed reports
3. The season becomes read-only
4. Historical data remains accessible

### Data Relationships

Understanding how data connects:

```
Team
├── Roster (players)
├── Seasons
│   └── Games
└── Tournaments
    └── Games
```

Games can exist:
- In a season
- In a tournament
- As standalone friendlies

## Best Practices

1. **Create seasons before games** - easier to organize
2. **Use descriptive names** - you'll thank yourself later
3. **Archive completed seasons** - keeps the interface clean
4. **Regular backups** - protect your organizational data
