This guide walks you through the recommended setup process to unlock the full potential of MatchOps Local. By following these steps, you'll have your match data organized, complete statistics functionality, and streamlined game day workflows.

<Callout type="info">
The [Quick Start](/guide/getting-started) guide gets you going fast. This Recommended Workflow takes more time upfront but saves time on every game day and provides richer statistics.
</Callout>

## Why Setup Matters

When you set up your data properly:

- **Game creation is faster** - Select a pre-built team and competition details auto-fill
- **Statistics are complete** - Events link to players, teams, competitions, and seasons
- **Historical tracking works** - Compare performance across seasons and tournaments
- **Naming is automatic** - Club season (e.g., "24/25") is added to competition names based on dates

## The Setup Flow

Follow these steps in order. Each step builds on the previous one.

## Step 0: Club Season Settings

<Callout type="warning">
This step is important! The club season period affects automatic naming of competitions and how statistics are grouped. Set this up first.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Settings">
Open the menu (☰) and select **Settings**.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Season Period">
Set the start and end dates for your club's season (e.g., October to May for most European clubs). This defines what counts as "in-season" vs "off-season".
</Step>
</Steps>

When you create competitions with dates, the club season (e.g., "24/25") is automatically calculated and can be added to names, reducing naming complexity.

## Step 1: Master Roster

Your master roster is the foundation. Add all players who might play for any of your teams.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Roster Settings">
Open the menu (☰) and select **All Players**.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Each Player">
Click **Add Player** and fill in:
- First name, last name, nickname (optional)
- Jersey number (optional)
- Position (optional, helps with formation planning)
</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
MatchOps does not collect personal information. All data stays on your device and is never saved to the cloud. Player names are used only as references within the app.
</Callout>

**Key points:**
- Players in the master roster can be assigned to multiple teams
- Assessments (ratings) are player-specific and carry across teams
- You can always add more players later

See [Roster Management](/guide/roster-management) for detailed instructions.

## Step 2: Personnel

Add coaches, assistant coaches, and other staff members.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Personnel">
Open the menu (☰) and select **Personnel**.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Staff Members">
Click **Add Personnel** and enter:
- Name
- Role (Coach, Assistant Coach, Team Manager, Physio, Other)
</Step>
</Steps>

Personnel can be assigned to individual games when creating or editing a game.

See [Teams & Organization](/guide/teams-organization#personnel) for details.

## Step 3: Competitions

Create your seasons and tournaments before building teams.

### Seasons

Seasons are for league play or ongoing competitions.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Seasons">
Open the menu (☰) and select **Seasons**.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a Season">
Click **New Season** and configure:
- **Name** - The season name (club season period like "24/25" is automatically calculated and displayed with the name when you set the start date)
- **Date range** - Start and end dates
- **League** - Use the 3-step dropdown system: level (level 1, level 2, etc.), area (east, west, etc.), and series name (local, regional, etc.)
- **Game type** - Soccer or Futsal
- **Game defaults** - Period length, number of periods, and other settings that will pre-fill for games in this season
</Step>
</Steps>

### Tournaments

Tournaments are for cup competitions or short events.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Tournaments">
Open the menu (☰) and select **Tournaments**.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a Tournament">
Click **New Tournament** and configure:
- **Name** - The tournament name (club season period is automatically calculated and displayed)
- **Date range** - Start and end dates
- **Series/Levels** - Add competition levels (Elite, Kilpa, Haaste, Harraste) - you can have multiple levels in one tournament
- **Game type** - Soccer or Futsal
- **Game defaults** - Settings that will pre-fill for games in this tournament
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
When you add series levels to a tournament, you can later assign teams and games to specific levels within that tournament.
</Callout>

See [Teams & Organization](/guide/teams-organization#seasons-and-tournaments) for details.

## Step 4: Teams

Now bring it all together by creating teams.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Teams">
Open the menu (☰) and select **My Teams**.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a Team">
Click **New Team** and configure:
- Team name
- Default game type (Soccer or Futsal)
</Step>

<Step title="Assign Players">
Select players from your master roster to add to this team.
</Step>

<Step title="Link to Competition (Optional)">
Associate the team with a season or tournament. This enables automatic competition details when creating games.
</Step>
</Steps>

**The payoff:** When you create a new game and select this team, the competition details and available players auto-populate.

See [Teams & Organization](/guide/teams-organization#teams) for details.
