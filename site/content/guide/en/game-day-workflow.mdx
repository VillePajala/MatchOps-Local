## Before the Game

### 1. Create or Resume a Game

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the App">
Launch MatchOps Local. If you have a game in progress, you'll see the option to resume it.
</Step>

<Step title="Create New Game">
Open the menu (☰) and select **Start New Game**. Enter your team name (or select an existing team) and opponent name. Adjust other settings as needed - most have sensible defaults.
</Step>

<Step title="Associate with Season">
Optionally link the game to a season or tournament to track standings and statistics over time.
</Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Design Your Starting Formation

The soccer field view is for designing your formation and placing starting players. Once your game is created:

1. **Select players** from the Player Bar at the top of the screen
2. **Tap on the field** to place each player
3. Or use the **formation picker** (⊞) to place all players at once

Set up your formation before arriving at the field to save time during warmups.

### The Timer Overlay

The Timer Overlay is your main view during games. Tap the timer display in the control bar to open it, then keep it open throughout the match.

With the Timer Overlay open:
- The **Log Goal** and **Opponent +1** buttons are always at hand for quick goal logging
- You can also record the assister when logging goals
- **Play/Pause** - Toggle the timer with the play button
- **Period End** - Advance to the next period when the timer stops

### Starting the Match

1. Open the Timer Overlay
2. Tap the **Play** button (▶) to start the clock
3. Keep the overlay open - you're ready to track events

### Tracking Events

During play, you can record:

- **Goals** - Use the **Log Goal** or **Opponent +1** buttons in the Timer Overlay. You can also record the assister.
- **Fair Play Cards** - Award via **Game Settings** in the menu (☰)
- **Notes** - Add text notes for specific moments

<Callout type="info">
The Fair Play Card is awarded to a player who shows outstanding sportsmanship, persistence, and positive attitude during the game. One player per game can receive it.

## Halftime

When the period ends (the timer stops automatically):

1. Review first-half statistics
2. Adjust your formation on the field view for the second half
3. Use the **Tactics Mode** for team talk visualizations

Your lineup and all events are automatically saved. You can safely close the app during halftime.
