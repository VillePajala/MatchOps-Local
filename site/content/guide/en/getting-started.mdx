Welcome to MatchOps! This guide will help you get up and running quickly. The app works for both soccer and futsal - choose your game type when creating games, seasons, or tournaments.

<Callout type="tip">
MatchOps works completely offline after the first load. You can start with local-only storage (no account) or create a cloud account for cross-device sync.

- Best for single-device use

Tap **Start without an account** to start using the app immediately.

- Cross-device sync

- Still works offline (syncs when connected)

Tap **Use Cloud Sync** to create an account or sign in.

Not sure which to choose? Start locally - you can migrate to cloud mode anytime later in Settings.
