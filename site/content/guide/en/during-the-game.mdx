Learn how to use MatchOps effectively during live matches to track events and manage your team.

## The Game Interface

When a game is active, you'll see:

- **Field View** - Your lineup positioned on the pitch
- **Timer** - Current game time and period
- **Score** - Live score display
- **Player Bar** - Players at the top, ready for selection

## Recording Events

### Goals

When a goal is scored:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Timer Overlay">
Tap the timer display in the control bar to open the Timer Overlay.
</Step>

<Step title="Log the Goal">
Use the **Log Goal** button for your team's goals, or **Opponent +1** for the opposition.
</Step>

<Step title="Record Details">
For your team's goals, select:
- Goalscorer (required - select from your roster)
- Assist player (optional)
- Game time (auto-filled from timer)
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm">
Click **Log Goal** - the score updates and the event is logged.
</Step>
</Steps>

You can also **edit or delete** recorded goals later through the Goal Log modal or Game Settings.

### Field View and Formation

The soccer field view is primarily for designing formations before the game and at halftime - not for real-time tracking during play. You can move player discs between positions, but this is for visual planning only and does not record substitutions or track individual playing time.

### Fair Play Cards

To award a Fair Play Card:

1. Open the menu (☰) and select **Game Settings**
2. Scroll to the Fair Play Card section
3. Select the player being recognized from the dropdown
4. The card is saved automatically

<Callout type="tip">
The Fair Play Card recognizes outstanding sportsmanship, persistence, and positive attitude. One player per game can receive it.
</Callout>

### Game Notes

You can add notes to capture important moments during the game using the notes feature.

## Timer Management

### Timer Overlay

The Timer Overlay is your main view during games. Open it by tapping the timer display in the control bar.

All game controls are in the Timer Overlay:

- **Play/Pause** - Toggle the timer using the play button (▶/⏸)
- **Goal Logging** - Use **Log Goal** or **Opponent +1** buttons to record goals
- **Period Transitions** - When a period ends, the timer stops automatically. Press play to start the next period.

### Substitution Interval Tracker

The Timer Overlay includes a substitution interval reminder to help you rotate players at regular intervals:

1. **Set Interval** - Configure how often you want to rotate players (e.g., every 5 minutes)
2. **Visual Alerts** - The display changes color as substitution time approaches:
   - Normal (white) - Plenty of time
   - Warning (orange) - Substitution time approaching
   - Due (red) - Time to make substitutions
3. **Confirm Button** - Click "Substitution Made" when you complete a rotation
4. **Reset** - The timer resets and begins tracking the next interval

<Callout type="info">
The interval tracker is a visual reminder only - it does not track which players are substituted or calculate individual playing times. You manage the actual substitutions on the field yourself.
</Callout>

### Period Transitions

When a period ends (timer stops automatically):

1. Review period statistics
2. Adjust your formation on the field view
3. Press play to start the next period

## Making Adjustments

### Formation Changes

During the game, you can rearrange players on the field:

**Option 1: Drag**
- Drag a player disc to a new position on the field

**Option 2: Tap to swap**
- Tap a player to select them, then tap another player disc to swap positions

Changes happen instantly.

### Field Tools Panel

Access additional tools from the control bar. Available tools depend on the current mode:

**Normal field view:**
- **Tactics** - Toggle tactical mode on/off
- **Place All** (⊞) - Auto-position players using formation presets (3v3 to 11v11)
- **Clear** - Remove all drawings from the field
- **Reset** - Return all players to bench

**Tactical mode adds:**
- **Undo/Redo** - Reverse or repeat tactical changes
- **Add Home** - Place home team tactical discs
- **Add Opponent** - Place opponent tactical discs

<Callout type="info">
All data in the app is saved automatically after each action, so manual saving is not typically needed. However, **Quick Save** is available from the menu (☰) under Game Management if you want to ensure all changes are saved.
</Callout>

### Tactics Mode

For more detailed tactical adjustments, use the **Tactics Mode**:

1. Click the **Tactics Mode** button
2. Draw plays, formations, or instructions
3. Place tactical discs (home/opponent/goalie)
4. Position the ball on the field
5. Show players during halftime discussions
6. See [Tactics Board](/guide/tactics-board) for detailed instructions

<Callout type="info">
The Tactical Board has its own separate Undo/Redo history, so you can experiment without affecting your main field setup.

## Tips for Live Tracking

<Callout type="tip">
**Keep it simple during play** - Focus on goals. Add details after the game.

### Priority Order

1. **Goals** - Always record immediately
2. **Fair Play Cards** - Award when you notice good behavior
3. **Notes** - Add during stoppages

### Screen Lock Prevention

MatchOps keeps your screen active during games. The wake lock feature:

- Prevents screen timeout
- Saves battery when paused
- Works on most devices
