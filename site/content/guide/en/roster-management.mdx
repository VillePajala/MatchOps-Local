- **Intensity** - Game engagement and work rate
- **Courage** - Bravery and willingness to challenge
- **Duels** - Performance in contested situations
- **Technique** - Ball control and skill
- **Creativity** - Ability to create chances and play-making
- **Decisions** - Decision-making quality
- **Awareness** - Game awareness and positioning
- **Teamwork** - Cooperation and support for teammates
- **Fair Play** - Discipline and conduct
- **Impact** - Overall effect on game

Additionally, you can set an **Overall Score** (1-10) and add **Notes** for detailed observations. The assessment also tracks **Minutes Played** automatically.

## Organizing Your Roster

- **Last Name** - Alphabetical by surname (default)
