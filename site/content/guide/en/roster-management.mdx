- **Ball Control** - Technical ball handling skills
- **Passing** - Accuracy and vision
- **Shooting** - Finishing ability
- **Speed** - Pace and acceleration
- **Endurance** - Stamina and work rate
- **Positioning** - Tactical awareness
- **Defending** - Defensive skills
- **Heading** - Aerial ability
- **Teamwork** - Cooperation and communication
- **Attitude** - Mental approach and commitment

Each dimension is rated on a scale, helping you track player development over time.

Player assessments are private and stored only on your device. They're useful for tracking individual development goals.

## Organizing Your Roster

### Sorting Options

Sort your roster by:
- Jersey number

2. Click the **Delete** button

## Multiple Teams

If you coach multiple teams, use the Teams and Seasons system:

## Data Backup

Your roster data is stored locally on your device. To protect against data loss:

1. Use the **Export** feature regularly
2. Save backups to cloud storage or another device
3. Export before device changes or updates

See [Data Management](/guide/data-management) for detailed backup instructions.
