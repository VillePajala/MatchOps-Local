Find answers to the most common questions about MatchOps.

## Getting Started

### How do I install the app?

Open the app in your browser. The app will prompt you to install it - just tap "Install" or "Add to Home Screen". On Android, you can also install from the Play Store.

### Where is my data stored?

All data is stored locally on your device. Nothing is sent to external servers. Your privacy is protected by design.

### Can I use it on multiple devices?

Yes, but you'll need to export your data from one device and import it on another. There's no automatic syncing since everything is stored locally.

## Data Management

### How do I back up my data?

Open the Settings menu and use the Export function. This creates a JSON file with all your data that you can save and import later.

### What happens if I lose my phone or it breaks?

If you've made regular exports (backups), you can import your data on a new device. Without backups, data is lost with the device.
