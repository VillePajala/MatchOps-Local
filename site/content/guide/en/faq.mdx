Find answers to the most common questions about MatchOps.

## Getting Started

### How do I install the app?

Open the app in your browser. The app will prompt you to install it - just tap "Install" or "Add to Home Screen". On Android, you can also install from the Play Store.

### Do I need an account?

No, an account is optional. You can use MatchOps with local-only storage (no account needed) or create a cloud account for cross-device sync. Choose your preference when you first open the app.

### Where is my data stored?

It depends on your chosen mode:

- **Local mode**: Data is stored only on your device. Maximum privacy.
- **Cloud mode**: Data is stored securely in the cloud (Supabase, EU region) and syncs across devices.

Both modes work offline. Your privacy is protected by design.

### Is there cloud sync?

Yes! Cloud sync is optional. Create an account to sync your data across multiple devices automatically. You can also start with local mode and migrate to cloud later.

## Cloud & Sync

### Can I use the app on multiple devices?

Yes, with two options:

- **Cloud mode (recommended)**: Create an account and your data syncs automatically across all your devices.
- **Local mode**: Export your data from one device and import it on another manually.

### What happens if I'm offline with a cloud account?

The app works normally! All changes save to your device immediately. When you're back online, everything syncs automatically. You won't lose any data.

<Callout type="tip">
You can track an entire game without internet. Data syncs when you reconnect.
</Callout>

### How do I switch between local and cloud mode?

Open Settings and look for the cloud/sync options. You can:

- **Local → Cloud**: Create an account and migrate your existing data
- **Cloud → Local**: Switch to local-only storage (data stays in your cloud account but stops syncing)

### Is my data private in cloud mode?

Yes. In cloud mode:

- Data is stored in Supabase (EU region)
- Protected by your account credentials
- Row-level security ensures only you can access your data
- No sharing with third parties
- You can delete your account and all data anytime

## Data Management

### How do I back up my data?

Open the menu (☰) and select **Backup & Restore**. Use the Export function to create a JSON file with all your data.

<Callout type="info">
Cloud mode users: Your data is automatically backed up to the cloud. Manual backups are still recommended for extra protection.
</Callout>

### What happens if I lose my phone or it breaks?

**Cloud mode users**: Simply sign in on your new device - all your data is there.

**Local mode users**: If you've made regular backups, import your data on a new device. Without backups, data is lost with the device.

<Callout type="tip">
Make it a habit to export your data regularly, especially after important games or at the end of each season.
</Callout>

### Can I edit game data after it's recorded?

Yes. You can edit, add, or delete goal events and modify match details. Just open the game from your history and make corrections.

## Features

### Can I manage multiple teams?

Yes. You can create and manage multiple teams (U12, U14, etc.) from the same app and switch between them easily.

### Can I share statistics with other coaches?

Yes. You can export statistics in Excel or JSON format and share the files with other coaches via email or messaging apps.

## Technical

### How much storage space does the app use?

The app uses your device's free storage space. Typical usage with 100+ games and full statistics is under 50MB.

### How do I update the app?

The app updates automatically when you open it and have an internet connection. After an update, the app will notify you of the new version and ask you to reload the page.

### Does the app work offline?

Yes! After the first load, the app works completely offline. You can track games without any internet connection. If you're using cloud mode, data syncs when you reconnect.
