## During Games

### Keep It Simple

Don't try to track everything. Focus on what matters:
- **Goals** - always record
- **Fair Play Cards** - when you notice good behavior
- **Key notes** - during stoppages

### Device Placement

**Position your device so you can:**
- Glance at it without breaking focus
- Reach it quickly for updates
- Protect it from weather and impact

**Tip:** A tablet offers better visibility. A phone works well in a lanyard.

### Timing Substitutions

Tips for managing player rotation:

1. **Use the interval reminder** - Set substitution reminders in the Timer Overlay
2. **Balance throughout** - Don't save all subs for the end
3. **Know your rules** - Substitution rules vary by age group and league

### Weather Considerations

Outdoor coaching means dealing with the elements:

- **Cold weather**: Keep device in pocket between uses - cold drains battery fast
- **Rain**: Use a protective case or plastic bag
- **Sun**: Avoid direct sunlight on screen - reduces visibility

## Post-Game Habits

### Immediate Actions

Right after the final whistle:

1. **Verify score** - Confirm goals are recorded correctly
2. **Quick notes** - Jot down observations while fresh
3. **End game** - Finalize in the app

### Same-Day Review

Within a few hours:

- Note standout performances
- Record any observations about players
- Add context to events

### Weekly Routine

Establish a regular routine:

- **Sunday**: Review week's games
- **Monday**: Export data if needed
- **Mid-week**: Plan for upcoming games
- **Regularly**: Backup your data

## Roster Management

### Keep It Current

- Remove players who've left
- Add new players immediately
- Update jersey numbers as needed
- Mark players who miss games

### Use Player Assessments

The assessment feature helps:

- Track development over time
- Remember player strengths and areas for improvement
- Make informed lineup decisions

### Player Notes

Use notes for:

- Preferred positions
- Playing time commitments (other activities, travel)
- Personal development goals
- Health information and limitations

<Callout type="info">
Player notes are private to you - they're never shared with anyone.

## Fair Play Cards

Fair Play Cards are an important educational tool in youth soccer.

### When to Award

Give a card when a player:
- Helps an opponent up after a fall
- Honestly admits their own foul
- Encourages a teammate in a difficult moment
- Shows exceptional sportsmanship

### Tracking in the App

- Record cards during the game as events
- Player statistics show total card count
- At season end, see who earned the most cards

<Callout type="tip">
Distributing Fair Play Cards evenly across the team encourages good behavior from everyone.

## Seasons and Organization

### Create Seasons Early

Start your season in the app before the first game:
- Games automatically link to season
- Statistics accumulate properly
- Organization stays clean

### Use Clear Names

**Teams**: Keep names simple (e.g., "PePo Lila", "KuPS Hirvet")

**Competitions**: Use descriptive names without the club season period (e.g., "Spring League", "Helsinki Cup")

Bad example: "Games 2025" - too vague

### Archive Completed Seasons

After a season:
1. Export final statistics
2. Archive the season
3. Keep the interface clean

## Data Safety

### Backup Rules

**Cloud mode users**: Your data is automatically backed up to the cloud and synced across devices. Manual backups are still recommended for extra protection.

**All users**:
- **Weekly**: Minimum backup frequency for manual exports
- **After important games**: Extra protection
- **Before updates**: Always backup first
- **Multiple copies**: Don't rely on one location

### Sharing Data

When sharing statistics:
- Only include necessary information
- Use secure channels
- Delete shared files after sending

## Advanced Tips

### Substitution Patterns

Track patterns over time:
- Which players work well together?
- Which subs work best in which situations?
- What's the optimal rotation rhythm?

### Tactical Notes

Use the Tactical Board for:
- Pre-game formation setup
- Halftime adjustments
- Set piece practice
- Post-game analysis

### Long-Term Analysis

Look at trends across games:
- Scoring patterns and methods
- Defensive challenges
- Individual player development arcs
- Formation effectiveness

## Common Mistakes

Avoid these pitfalls:

1. **Not backing up** - Data loss is preventable
2. **Overcomplicating tracking** - Simple systems last
3. **Waiting to set up** - Prepare in advance
4. **Skipping post-game notes** - Record while memory is fresh

<Callout type="tip">
The best system is one you'll actually use. Start simple and add features only when the basics are working smoothly.
