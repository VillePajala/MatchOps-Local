## During Games

### Keep It Simple

Don't try to track everything. Focus on:
- Goals (always)
- Substitutions (always)
- Fair Play Cards (when you notice good behavior)
- Key notes (during stoppages)

### Device Management

**Position your device where you can**:
- Glance at it without breaking focus
- Reach it quickly for updates
- Protect it from weather and impact

**Recommended**: Use a tablet for better visibility, or phone in a lanyard.

### Timing Substitutions

Tips for managing playing time:

1. **Set mental checkpoints** - Check time at regular intervals
2. **Use halftime wisely** - Review first-half minutes
3. **Balance throughout** - Don't save all subs for the end
4. **Know your rules** - Substitution rules vary by age/league

## Post-Game Habits

### Immediate Actions

Right after the final whistle:

1. **Verify score** - Confirm goals are recorded correctly
2. **Quick notes** - Jot down observations while fresh
3. **End game** - Finalize in the app

### Same-Day Review

Within a few hours:

- Check playing time distribution
- Note standout performances
- Record any discipline issues
- Add context to events

### Weekly Routine

Establish a routine:

- Sunday: Review week's games
- Monday: Export data if needed
- Mid-week: Plan for upcoming games
- Regular: Backup your data

## Roster Management

### Keep It Current

- Remove players who've left
- Add new players immediately
- Update jersey numbers as needed
- Mark players who miss games

### Use Player Assessments

The player assessment feature helps:

- Guide lineup decisions

## Seasons and Organization

### Create Seasons Early

Start your season in the app before the first game:
- Games automatically link to season
- Statistics accumulate properly
- Organization is cleaner

### Use Descriptive Names

Good: "EKK U12 Boys Spring 2025"
Bad: "Games 2025"

### Archive Completed Seasons

After a season:
1. Export final statistics
2. Archive the season
3. Keep the interface clean

## Data Safety

### Backup Rules

- **Weekly**: Minimum backup frequency
- **After important games**: Extra protection
- **Before updates**: Always backup first
- **Multiple locations**: Don't keep one copy

### Share Carefully

When sharing exports:
- Only include necessary data
- Use secure channels
- Delete after sharing

## Advanced Tips

### Substitution Patterns

Track patterns over time:
- Who plays well together?
- Which subs work best when?
- Optimal rotation timing?

### Tactical Notes

Use the Tactical Board for:
- Pre-game formation setup
- Halftime adjustments

### Long-Term Analysis

Look at trends across games:

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

2. **Overcomplicating tracking** - Simple is sustainable
3. **Ignoring playing time** - Fairness matters
4. **Waiting to set up** - Prepare in advance
5. **Skipping post-game** - Review while memory is fresh
