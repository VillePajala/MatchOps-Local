This guide helps you resolve common issues with MatchOps.

## Data Issues

### Data Not Saving

**Problem**: Changes aren't persisting between sessions.

**Solutions**:
- Check that the app has storage permissions in Android settings
- Verify you have available storage space on your device
- Try manually saving before closing the app

### Lost Data

**Problem**: Previous games or players have disappeared.

**Causes**:
- App data was cleared in Android settings
- App was uninstalled and reinstalled
- Using a different device than before

**Recovery**:
- **Cloud mode users**: Sign out and sign back in to re-sync from cloud
- **Local mode users**: Restore from backup if available
- Check if you're on the correct device
- Contact support if data should exist

### Import/Export Not Working

**Problem**: Can't import backup or export data.

**Solutions**:
- Check file format (JSON for backups, xlsx for Excel)
- Ensure file isn't corrupted
- Try a smaller data subset
- Check that the app has file access permissions

## Cloud Sync Issues

### Data Not Syncing

**Problem**: Changes made on one device don't appear on another.

**Solutions**:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Look for sync status indicator - if it shows "Pending", wait for sync to complete
3. Reload the page or close and reopen the app
4. Verify you're signed into the same account on both devices
5. Try signing out and back in

### Sync Stuck or Failing

**Problem**: Sync indicator shows pending changes that won't sync.

**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Wait a few minutes - the app retries automatically
3. Close and reopen the app
4. If still stuck, try signing out and back in

<Callout type="info">
If you have pending changes and go offline, they're safely stored and will sync when you reconnect.
</Callout>

### Offline with Cloud Account

**Problem**: Worried about using the app offline with a cloud account.

**This is normal and works fine!**
- All changes save to your device immediately
- Data syncs automatically when you reconnect
- No data is lost during offline periods
- You can track entire games without internet

<Callout type="tip">
The app is designed to work offline. Track your game, and everything syncs when you're back online.
</Callout>

## Authentication Issues

### Can't Sign In

**Problem**: Unable to log into your account.

**Solutions**:

2. Check if Caps Lock is on
3. Try the "Forgot Password" option to reset
4. Check your internet connection

### Forgot Password

**Problem**: Can't remember your password.

**Solution**:
1. On the sign-in screen, tap **Forgot Password**
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your email (including spam folder) for reset link
4. Click the link and set a new password
5. Return to the app and sign in

### Session Expired

**Problem**: App asks you to sign in again unexpectedly.

**Causes**:
- Sessions expire after extended periods of inactivity
- App was cleared from memory by the system

**Solution**: Simply sign in again. Your data is safe in the cloud.

### Account Creation Problems

**Solutions**:

## Performance Issues

### App Running Slowly

**Problem**: The app is sluggish or unresponsive.

**Solutions**:
1. Close other apps running in the background
2. Restart the app
3. Clear app cache in Android settings
4. Reduce stored data (archive old seasons)

### Timer Not Accurate

**Problem**: The game timer seems off.

**Causes**:
- Device was sleeping
- App was in background

**Solutions**:
- Keep the app in the foreground during games
- The app automatically keeps the screen awake during active game timing
- Don't switch apps during active timing
- Disable battery optimization for MatchOps

## Display Issues

### Screen Orientation Problems

**Problem**: Layout looks wrong in portrait/landscape.

**Solutions**:
- Lock device orientation to your preference
- Use the app in recommended orientation (landscape for tablet, portrait for phone)
- Restart the app after rotation if display is incorrect

### Elements Missing or Cut Off

**Problem**: Can't see all the interface elements.

**Solutions**:
- Check device display settings (font size, display scaling)
- Try fullscreen mode
- Check device screen size compatibility

## Connectivity Issues

### Offline Mode Not Working

**Problem**: App doesn't work without internet.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you've opened the app at least once with internet connection
- The app needs to download resources on first launch
- Try reinstalling the app

<Callout type="tip">
After first launch, the app should work offline. Test by enabling airplane mode and reopening.
</Callout>

## Android-Specific Issues

### Background Restrictions

Common issues:
- Timer pauses when app is in background
- Notifications not appearing

**Solutions**:
- Disable battery optimization for MatchOps
- Grant all requested permissions
- Keep app in foreground during games
- Check Android's adaptive battery settings

### Storage Permission Issues

**Problem**: App asks for storage permission repeatedly or can't save files.

**Solutions**:
- Grant storage permissions in Android Settings > Apps > MatchOps
- On Android 13+, grant "Photos and videos" or "Files" permission as needed
- Restart the app after granting permissions
