ðŸŽ¯ BUNDLE OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on current analysis, focus on these areas:

ðŸ”´ HIGH IMPACT (Expected 40-60kB savings):
  1. Lazy load Recharts library (~50kB)
  2. Split large modal components (~30kB)
  3. Lazy load Sentry error feedback (~20kB)

ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM IMPACT (Expected 20-30kB savings):
  1. Optimize React Icons usage (~15kB)
  2. Code split utility functions (~10kB)
  3. Lazy load export features (~15kB)

ðŸŸ¢ LOW IMPACT (Expected 10-15kB savings):
  1. Optimize image assets (~5kB)
  2. Tree-shake unused utilities (~5kB)
  3. Optimize font loading (~5kB)

ðŸŽ¯ TARGET: Reduce from 500kB â†’ 350kB (30% reduction)
ðŸ“Š EXPECTED TOTAL SAVINGS: 70-105kB (14-21% reduction)

Next steps:
1. Review .next/analyze/client.html for detailed breakdown
2. Implement Phase 4B: Code Splitting for components
3. Implement Phase 4C: Lazy loading for libraries
