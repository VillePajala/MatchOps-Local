🎯 BUNDLE OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on current analysis, focus on these areas:

🔴 HIGH IMPACT (Expected 40-70kB savings):
  1. Lazy load Recharts library (~50kB)
  2. Split large modal components (~30kB)  
  3. Optimize Sentry integration (~30-50kB with dynamic imports)

🟡 MEDIUM IMPACT (Expected 20-30kB savings):
  1. Optimize React Icons usage (~15kB)
  2. Code split utility functions (~10kB)
  3. Lazy load export features (~15kB)

🟢 LOW IMPACT (Expected 10-15kB savings):
  1. Optimize image assets (~5kB)
  2. Tree-shake unused utilities (~5kB)
  3. Optimize font loading (~5kB)

🎯 TARGET: Optimize bundle size based on current analysis  
📊 EXPECTED TOTAL SAVINGS: 80-125kB (varies by current bundle size)
⚠️  SENTRY IMPACT: ~30-50kB added, but dynamic imports reduce initial load

Next steps:
1. Review .next/analyze/client.html for detailed breakdown
2. Implement Phase 4B: Code Splitting for components
3. Implement Phase 4C: Lazy loading for libraries
4. Monitor Sentry bundle impact with dynamic imports
