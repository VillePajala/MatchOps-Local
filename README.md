## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VillePajala/soccer-pre-game-app.git
    cd soccer-pre-game-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to start using the app.

   When launched, a **Start Screen** appears with options to start a new game, load an existing one, create a season or tournament, or view statistics. Select an action to continue to the main field view.

## Development Commands

### Core Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (Next.js)
- `npm run build` - Build for production (includes manifest generation)
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm test` - Run all Jest tests (executes `jest`)
- `npm run test:unit` - Alias for `npm test`
- `npm run generate:i18n-types` - Generate TypeScript types for translations

### Build Process
The build process includes a custom manifest generation step that runs before Next.js build:
- `node scripts/generate-manifest.mjs` - Generates PWA manifest based on branch
- Manifest configuration varies by branch (master vs development) for different app names and themes

## Running Tests

Install project dependencies with `npm install` as shown above. Then execute the automated test suite with:

```bash
npm test
# or
npm run test:unit
```

The tests rely on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests cover utilities and components and are co-located with source files using the `.test.tsx` suffix
- The Jest configuration excludes Playwright specs located in the `/tests/` directory

## Architecture Overview

### Data Flow
The app's data layer relies on **React Query** to fetch, cache, and manage server-side state (persisted in localStorage). Asynchronous wrappers in `src/utils/localStorage.ts` are used for direct localStorage access. This approach centralizes data fetching and reduces manual state management.

### PWA Structure
The app is a full PWA with:
- Custom service worker (`public/sw.js`)
- Dynamic manifest generation based on git branch
- Install prompts and update notifications

### State Management
- **`src/app/page.tsx`**: Acts as the central orchestrator, bringing together different state management strategies.
- **`useReducer` (`useGameSessionReducer.ts`)**: Manages the core game session state, including score, timer, periods, and game metadata. This provides predictable state transitions.
- **`useGameState` hook**: Manages the interactive state of the soccer field, including player positions on the field and drawings.
- **React Query**: Handles all asynchronous data operations, such as fetching and updating the master roster, seasons, tournaments, and saved games.
- **`useState`**: Used for managing local UI state within components (e.g., modal visibility).

### Key Components
- `SoccerField` - Interactive drag-and-drop field
- `PlayerBar` - Player roster management
- `ControlBar` - Main app controls
- Various modals for game settings, stats, and management

### Data Persistence
All data is stored in browser localStorage with async wrappers in `src/utils/localStorage.ts`. Key data includes:
- Player roster (`src/utils/masterRosterManager.ts`)
- Game saves (`src/utils/savedGames.ts`)
- Seasons and tournaments (`src/utils/seasons.ts`, `src/utils/tournaments.ts`)
- App settings (`src/utils/appSettings.ts`)

## Key Files to Understand

- `src/app/page.tsx` - The main component that orchestrates the entire application, integrating hooks, reducers, and data fetching.
- `src/hooks/useGameSessionReducer.ts` - The reducer managing core game logic (timer, score, status). Crucial for understanding state transitions.
- `src/hooks/useGameState.ts` - The hook for managing interactive state on the soccer field (player positions, drawings).
- `src/utils/masterRosterManager.ts` - Handles all CRUD operations for the master player list, interacting with localStorage.
- `src/config/queryKeys.ts` - Defines the keys used for caching and invalidating data with React Query.
- `src/types/index.ts` - Core TypeScript interfaces (Player, Season, Tournament, AppState).
- `src/utils/localStorage.ts` - Async localStorage wrapper utilities.

## Important Notes

### Data Storage
All your data is stored in your browser's `localStorage`. This enables:
- **Fast Performance:** Instant data access without network requests
- **Offline Capability:** Full functionality without internet connection
- **Privacy:** All data remains on your device

**Important:** Clearing your browser data will erase everything. **Use the "Full Backup" feature regularly!**

The app includes backup/restore functionality through `src/utils/fullBackup.ts`.

### Internationalization
The app supports English and Finnish with i18next. All translation files now live in `public/locales/`.

### PWA Features
The app includes install prompts, update notifications, and works offline. The service worker is updated during build to trigger cache updates.

### Offline Use
To get the best experience, install the app on your device when prompted by your browser ("Add to Home Screen" on mobile, or an install icon in the address bar on desktop).
