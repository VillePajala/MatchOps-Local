# Branch-Scoped Code Review — feat/season-date-specification (2025-10-30)

Author: Codex CLI

Scope: Only changes introduced on this branch compared to origin/master. Deep, file-referenced assessment focused on the new Season Period feature, related UI/logic, wake lock improvements, and minor support changes.

---

## What Changed (High-Level)

- Season filtering migrated from month-only to explicit month+day “Season Period” (template year) with UI, i18n, validation, and stats integration.
- Settings modal revamped to configure period start/end (month/day) with validation and React Query cohesion.
- GameStats updated: new ClubSeasonFilter UI, settings query, and use of date-based season utils.
- Core utils updated: club season logic (date-based), app settings migration + reset, robust latest-game sorting, refined storage error copy.
- Wake Lock hook hardened with reacquisition, retries, cleanup.
- Minor StartScreen visual polish and tagline.

## Detailed Findings and Feedback

### Season Period: App Settings + Migration

- src/utils/appSettings.ts:27
  - Adds date-based settings: `clubSeasonStartDate`, `clubSeasonEndDate`, `hasConfiguredSeasonDates` and auto-migrates legacy month-based fields to the new date format.
  - Migration is defensive: logs migration, preserves intent, and doesn’t break if save fails.
  - resetAppSettings now resets storage config as well.

- Strengths:
  - Sensible defaults (Oct 1 → May 1) using a template year approach.
  - Clear, one-way migration path; no runtime branching post-migration.

- Nits/Ideas:
  - Consider a one-time toast post-migration informing users that period settings were updated to a more precise format.

### Season Period: Club Season Utilities

- src/utils/clubSeason.ts:32
  - Replaces month-only logic with month+day template dates across:
    - `getClubSeasonForDate`, `extractClubSeasonsFromGames`, `filterGamesByClubSeason`, `getClubSeasonDateRange`, and validation via `validateSeasonDates`.
  - Off-season games are now excluded from available season options (UI still supports “All Periods”).

- Correctness:
  - `getClubSeasonForDate` now guards invalid `dateStr` and uses month+day comparisons; cross-year seasons handled correctly by comparing month/day pairs.
  - `getClubSeasonDateRange` returns inclusive bounds using the provided day components; consistent with the template year model.
  - `validateSeasonDates` enforces ISO format, valid calendar dates, and non-zero-length periods.

- Risks/Edge Cases:
  - Validation allows start > end to represent cross-year periods, which is intended; ensure UI copy reflects this (it does).
  - If corrupted game dates slip through (not matching YYYY-MM-DD), logic gracefully returns off-season — acceptable tradeoff.

### Settings UI: Period Configuration

- src/components/SettingsModal.tsx:44
  - Switched to month+day selectors with accessible labels and descriptions.
  - Defensive parsing helpers and auto-correction for invalid day/month combinations (e.g., Feb 30 → Feb 29).
  - Validates changes via `validateSeasonDates` and persists with `updateAppSettings`, setting `hasConfiguredSeasonDates: true`.
  - Invalidate query: `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: queryKeys.settings.detail() })` ensures consumers refresh.

- Strengths:
  - Good UX: day option count adapts to selected month; clear error toasts for invalid dates and save failures.
  - Accessibility: uses `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, and usable focusable controls.

- Suggestions:
  - Consider precomputing valid days array only when month changes to avoid recomputations on each render (micro-optimization).
  - Add a small inline helper text clarifying that year is a template and not persisted (already in description; might elevate slightly in UI).

### Game Stats: Filters and Cohesion

- src/components/GameStatsModal.tsx:16
  - Imports new date-based season utils; queries settings via React Query (`queryKeys.settings.detail`).
  - Adds reusable `ClubSeasonFilter` (with gear icon) to Player and Overall tabs.
  - Extracts available seasons from saved games with the new API and respects `hasConfiguredSeasonDates`.

- src/components/GameStatsModal/components/ClubSeasonFilter.tsx:1
  - Simple, reusable filter component with disabled state and helper gear button.

- src/components/PlayerStatsView.tsx:28
  - Prop change to accept `clubSeasonStartDate`/`clubSeasonEndDate` and filter with `getClubSeasonForDate`.

- Strengths:
  - Nice separation by adding a dedicated filter component; integrates well with existing tabs.
  - Query-based settings avoid prop-drilling and stay fresh via invalidation.

- Nits:
  - When settings are not configured, the filter disables — the gear pulse is a good affordance; also showing a one-time info toast (you already do via `handleOpenSeasonSettings`) is helpful.

### Wake Lock Reliability

- src/hooks/useWakeLock.ts:1
  - Introduces `desiredActiveRef`, retry/backoff strategy (5 attempts), stable refs, cleanup on unmount, and re-acquisition on release/visibility.
  - Listeners use `{ once: true }` to avoid accumulation and reattach on new locks.

- Strengths:
  - Fixes mid-game screen-sleep risk; better lifecycle hygiene.

- Nits:
  - Consider exponential backoff if devices are sensitive; 1s fixed delay is fine pragmatically.

### Robustness & Polish

- src/utils/savedGames.ts:260
  - Adds `parseDateSafely` and `extractTimestampFromGameId` to make `getLatestGameId` deterministic under malformed data; good logging.

- src/utils/storage.ts:232
  - Removes “network/offline” message from storage user-facing errors; aligns with local-first UX.

- src/config/queryKeys.ts:11
  - Adds namespaced `settings` keys used consistently across Settings and GameStats; solid pattern.

- src/components/StartScreen.tsx:120
  - Visual background + tagline added; no logic change beyond existing language sync.

- i18n
  - public/locales/{en,fi}/common.json updated with keys for period wording, errors, and UI text.
  - src/i18n-types.ts added/updated type safety; good alignment.

## Potential Improvements (Branch Scope)

- StartScreen visual backdrop
  - src/components/StartScreen.tsx:120
  - Consider respecting `prefers-reduced-motion` or providing a lighter variant for low-end devices to avoid GPU churn from large SVG/glow effects.

- SettingsModal data flow
  - src/components/SettingsModal.tsx:249
  - Minor micro-opts: memoize month/day arrays and `parseMonthDay` results per render; current approach is fine for typical usage.

- Consistent terminology
  - i18n keys changed from “Club Season” to “Season Period/Period”; ensure all related UI (including docs/screenshots) uses consistent nomenclature.

---

## Tests & DX

- Tests updated for appSettings and clubSeason APIs; the changes indicate good coverage of the new logic.
- Query invalidation ensures correctness without requiring manual refresh; good DX choice.

---

## Verdict

- The branch’s shift to date-based Season Periods is well implemented, with sensible UX, solid validation, and correctly integrated stats filtering. The wake lock reliability improvements strengthen match-day stability.
- No blockers found. Minor polish recommendations are optional and scoped.

If you want, I can draft quick patches for the optional improvements (reduced-motion gating on StartScreen and tiny memoizations), or proceed to validate behavior by running targeted tests locally.
