# MatchOps-Local: Project Overview

**A local-first soccer coaching PWA that puts coaches in control of their data**

## What is MatchOps-Local?

MatchOps-Local is a comprehensive Progressive Web App (PWA) designed specifically for soccer coaches who want complete control over their team data while maintaining the convenience of modern web applications. Unlike cloud-based alternatives, MatchOps-Local stores all data locally on the coach's device, ensuring privacy, reliability, and performance.

## The Problem We Solve
