# MatchOps-Local: Project Overview

**A local-first soccer coaching PWA that puts coaches in control of their data**

## What is MatchOps-Local?

MatchOps-Local is a comprehensive Progressive Web App (PWA) designed specifically for soccer coaches who want complete control over their team data while maintaining the convenience of modern web applications. Unlike cloud-based alternatives, MatchOps-Local stores all data locally on the coach's device, ensuring privacy, reliability, and performance.

## The Problem We Solve

### Traditional Soccer Coaching Challenges
- **Data Privacy Concerns**: Cloud apps store sensitive player and team information on external servers
- **Internet Dependency**: Most coaching apps become unusable without reliable internet connection
- **Data Ownership**: Coaches lose control over their data when using cloud services
- **Performance Issues**: Network latency affects real-time game management
- **Subscription Costs**: Ongoing fees for cloud storage and services

### Current Solutions Fall Short
- **Native Apps**: Platform-specific, require app store distribution, limited cross-device compatibility
- **Cloud Apps**: Privacy concerns, internet dependency, subscription costs
- **Spreadsheets**: Limited functionality, poor user experience, no real-time features
- **Paper Systems**: Inefficient, error-prone, no analytics capabilities

## Why This Project Matters

MatchOps-Local represents more than just another coaching app—it's a statement about data ownership, privacy, and the future of web applications. In an era of increasing data privacy concerns and cloud dependency, this project demonstrates that powerful, modern applications can run entirely on user devices while providing superior performance and user experience.

By choosing local-first architecture, we're not just solving technical challenges—we're empowering coaches and protecting young athletes' privacy while advancing the state of the art in modern web development.

### Scope & Boundaries

MatchOps-Local is intentionally focused as a **data capture tool** for individual coaches. Multi-coach data aggregation (combining statistics from multiple coaches after tournaments) is handled by external tooling, not within the app itself. This separation keeps the app simple and respects volunteer coaches' time. See [ADR-003](../05-development/architecture-decisions/ADR-003-data-aggregation-external-tooling.md) for details on this architectural decision.
