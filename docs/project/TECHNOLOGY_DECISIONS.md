### State Management: React Query + localStorage

#### **Decision Rationale**

**Why React Query for local-first applications?**

Traditional state management libraries (Redux, Zustand, Context API) are designed for in-memory state, not persistent data operations. React Query excels at async operations and caching, making it ideal for localStorage interactions.

**React Query Advantages:**
```typescript
// Traditional approach - complex state management
const [players, setPlayers] = useState([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [error, setError] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  setLoading(true);
  loadPlayers()
    .then(setPlayers)
    .catch(setError)
    .finally(() => setLoading(false));
}, []);

// React Query approach - simplified
const { data: players, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['players'],
  queryFn: loadPlayers,
});
```

**Key Benefits for Local-First:**
- **Automatic Caching**: Reduces localStorage read operations
- **Background Refetching**: Keeps data fresh across components
- **Error Boundaries**: Robust error handling for data operations
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with rollback on failure
- **Invalidation**: Intelligent cache updates after mutations

**Why localStorage over alternatives?**

| Storage Option | Capacity | Persistence | Sync API | Complexity | Privacy |
|----------------|----------|-------------|----------|------------|---------|
| **localStorage** | ~10MB | ✅ Permanent | ✅ Simple | ✅ Minimal | ✅ Local only |
| **IndexedDB** | ~GB+ | ✅ Permanent | ❌ Async only | ❌ Complex | ✅ Local only |
| **WebSQL** | ~5MB | ✅ Permanent | ✅ SQL | ❌ Deprecated | ✅ Local only |
| **Memory** | RAM limited | ❌ Session only | ✅ Instant | ✅ Simple | ✅ Local only |
| **Cloud DB** | Unlimited | ✅ Permanent | ❌ Async | ❌ Complex | ❌ External |

**localStorage Advantages:**
- **Simplicity**: Synchronous API perfect for React Query integration
- **Capacity**: 10MB+ sufficient for years of coaching data

### UI Framework: React 19 with TypeScript

#### **Decision Rationale**

**Why React 19?**

React remains the dominant frontend framework with the largest ecosystem and best tooling support. Version 19 introduces concurrent features that improve performance for data-heavy applications like coaching software.

**React 19 Advantages:**
- **Concurrent Rendering**: Better performance with large datasets
- **Suspense Integration**: Elegant loading states for data operations
- **Server Components**: Future extensibility if server features needed
- **Ecosystem**: Largest component library and community support
- **Team Expertise**: Development team's primary expertise area

**Why TypeScript?**

Local-first applications lack server-side validation, making client-side type safety critical:

```typescript
// Without TypeScript - runtime errors possible
function addPlayer(player) {
  // What if player.name is undefined?
  // What if player.jerseyNumber is a string?
  // What if required fields are missing?
}

// With TypeScript - compile-time error prevention
interface Player {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  jerseyNumber: number;
  position: Position;
}

function addPlayer(player: Player): void {
  // Type system guarantees valid data structure
}
```

**TypeScript Benefits for Local-First:**
- **Data Validation**: Prevents invalid data from corrupting localStorage
- **API Safety**: Ensures localStorage interactions use correct data types
- **Refactoring**: Safe code changes with confidence in data integrity
- **Documentation**: Types serve as living documentation of data structures
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent IDE support for large codebase maintenance

#### **Trade-offs Accepted**
- **Build Complexity**: TypeScript adds compilation step and configuration
- **Learning Curve**: Requires TypeScript knowledge for contributors
- **Bundle Size**: Slightly larger bundles due to type information (minimal impact)

#### **Alternatives Considered**
- **Vue 3**: Excellent performance but smaller ecosystem and team expertise
- **Svelte**: Smaller bundle sizes but limited component ecosystem
- **Angular**: Full framework but overly complex for our needs
- **Plain JavaScript**: Simpler but lacks type safety critical for local-first data integrity
