## Pre-Deployment Code Fixes

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (BLOCKING - Must Complete First)

#### 1. PWA Icon Resolution Issues
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Files:** `public/manifest.json`, icon assets
**Issue:** Manifest declares 192x192 and 512x512 icons but actual image is 500x500

**Action Items:**
```bash
# Create proper icon sizes
# Generate 192x192 icon
convert public/pepo-logo-dev.png -resize 192x192 public/icons/icon-192x192.png

# Generate 512x512 icon  
convert public/pepo-logo-dev.png -resize 512x512 public/icons/icon-512x512.png

# Update manifest.json paths
```

**Updated manifest.json:**
```json
{
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "maskable any"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-512x512.png", 
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "maskable any"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Security Vulnerabilities
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Issue:** 3 moderate security vulnerabilities in Next.js 15.3.5

**Action Items:**
```bash
# Update dependencies
npm audit fix
npm update next

# Verify fixes
npm audit --audit-level moderate
```

#### 3. Service Worker Caching Strategy
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**File:** `public/sw.js`
**Issue:** No offline functionality implemented

**Action Items:**
Create robust caching strategy:
```javascript
// public/sw.js - Enhanced version needed
const CACHE_NAME = 'matchops-v1';
const STATIC_RESOURCES = [
  '/',
  '/static/css/app.css',
  '/static/js/app.js',
  '/icons/icon-192x192.png',
  '/icons/icon-512x512.png'
];

// Implement cache-first for static resources
// Implement network-first for API calls
// Add offline fallbacks
```

#### 4. Complete PWA Manifest
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**File:** `public/manifest.json`

**Missing Required Fields:**
```json
{
  "orientation": "portrait",
  "categories": ["sports", "productivity"],
  "lang": "en-US",
  "dir": "ltr",
  "scope": "/",
  "prefer_related_applications": false
}
```

### Phase 2: High Priority Fixes

#### 5. Privacy Policy Implementation
**Priority:** HIGH
**Issue:** Vercel Analytics requires privacy policy

**Action Items:**
1. Create privacy policy document
2. Host at `/privacy-policy` route
3. Add consent management for analytics
4. Update manifest with privacy policy URL

#### 6. Additional PWA Assets
**Priority:** HIGH

**Required Assets:**
- `public/favicon.ico`
- `public/apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180)
- `public/robots.txt`
- `public/sitemap.xml`

### Phase 3: Optimization Fixes

#### 7. Bundle Size Optimization
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Current:** 432 kB first load

**Action Items:**
```bash
# Analyze bundle
npm run build:analyze

# Implement code splitting in key components
# Optimize image loading
# Tree-shake unused dependencies
```

#### 8. Performance Enhancements
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Action Items:**
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Add image optimization
- Minimize JavaScript bundle
- Enable compression
