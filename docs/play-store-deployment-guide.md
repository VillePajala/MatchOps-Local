## Pre-Deployment Code Fixes

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (BLOCKING - Must Complete First)

#### 1. PWA Icons & Manifest Verification
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Files:** `public/manifest.json`, icon assets
**Reality:** Icons and manifest are already present and generated by `scripts/generate-manifest.mjs`.

**Action Items:**
- Verify that `manifest.json` contains correct `name`, `short_name`, `icons` (192x192, 512x512), `display`, `theme_color`, and `scope` for production.
- Confirm icons exist at `/icons/icon-192x192.png` and `/icons/icon-512x512.png` and are maskable.
- If assets change, update source images and re-run `npm run build` to regenerate manifest.

#### 2. Dependency & Security Audit
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Guidance:** Address critical production vulnerabilities; avoid blind `npm audit fix` that can introduce breaking changes.

**Action Items:**
- Run `npm audit --omit=dev` and address critical issues in production deps.
- For dev deps, track separately and update in a controlled PR.
- Verify changes with `npm run test` and `npm run build`.

#### 3. Service Worker Caching Strategy
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**File:** `public/sw.js`
**Reality:** SW exists with offline caching and update banner. It needs hardening, not a full rewrite.

**Action Items:**
Harden the existing SW:
- Restrict caching to static assets; avoid caching HTML documents long‑term.
- Add versioned cache cleanup on `activate` (delete old caches).
- Respect cacheability and reduce logging in production.
- Keep update flow via banner (`SKIP_WAITING` only on user action).

#### 4. Manifest Completeness
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**File:** `public/manifest.json`

**Action Items:**
- Ensure `orientation`, `categories`, `lang`, `dir`, `scope`, `prefer_related_applications` are present (the generator already includes these; verify outputs).

### Phase 2: High Priority Fixes

#### 5. Privacy Policy Implementation
**Priority:** HIGH
**Guidance:** Publish a Privacy Policy URL; align with local‑first (no data exfiltration). If analytics are used, disclose and provide consent options.

**Action Items:**
1. Create privacy policy document
2. Host at `/privacy-policy` route
3. Add consent management for analytics
4. Update manifest with privacy policy URL

#### 6. Additional PWA Assets
**Priority:** HIGH

**Required Assets:**
- `public/favicon.ico`
- `public/apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180)
- `public/robots.txt`
- `public/sitemap.xml`

### Phase 3: Optimization Fixes

#### 7. Bundle Size Optimization
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Current:** Verify current bundle size with `npm run build:analyze` and document baseline.

**Action Items:**
```bash
# Analyze bundle
npm run build:analyze

# Implement code splitting in key components
# Optimize image loading
# Tree-shake unused dependencies
```

#### 8. Performance Enhancements
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Action Items:**
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Add image optimization
- Minimize JavaScript bundle
- Enable compression

## Technical Architecture

### TWA (Trusted Web Activity) Setup

**Option A: PWABuilder (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install PWABuilder CLI
npm install -g @pwabuilder/cli

# Generate Android package
pwa-build --platform android
```

**Option B: Android Studio Manual Setup**
1. Create new Android project with TWA template
2. Configure `build.gradle` with PWA URL
3. Set up digital asset links verification
4. Configure app icons and metadata

### Required Configuration Files

#### Digital Asset Links
**File:** `.well-known/assetlinks.json`
```json
[{
  "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
  "target": {
    "namespace": "android_app",
    "package_name": "com.matchops.local",
    "sha256_cert_fingerprints": ["YOUR_SIGNING_KEY_FINGERPRINT"]
  }
}]
```

#### Vercel Configuration
**File:** `vercel.json`
```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/.well-known/assetlinks.json",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Type",
          "value": "application/json"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Verification

Perform these checks once Phase P1 (security headers/SW) is implemented:

### 1) Security Headers
- Command: `curl -sI https://your-app-domain | grep -Ei "content-security-policy|permissions-policy|referrer-policy|strict-transport-security|x-content-type-options|x-frame-options"`
- Expect to see (examples):
  - `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; ...`
  - `Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()`
  - `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload` (prod HTTPS only)
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or equivalent via CSP `frame-ancestors 'none'`

### 2) Service Worker & Caches
- DevTools → Application → Service Workers
  - SW is active, update via banner works (click update → reload occurs).
- DevTools → Application → Cache Storage
  - Single active cache with versioned name (e.g., `matchops-static-v2`).
  - Old caches deleted after new activation.
  - No HTML documents cached long‑term.

### 3) PWA & Manifest
- Lighthouse (PWA category) passes “Installable” checks.
- Manifest shows correct `name`, `short_name`, `icons` (192/512), `theme_color`, `display`, and `scope`.

### 4) TWA & Asset Links
- `https://your-app-domain/.well-known/assetlinks.json` is reachable and valid.
- Android app verifies Digital Asset Links (no “verification failed” in logcat when launching TWA).

### 5) Observability
- Sentry receives a test exception in staging with correct `environment` and `release`.
```

## Conclusion

This deployment plan addresses all identified technical issues and provides a comprehensive roadmap for successful Google Play Store launch. The estimated timeline is 2-3 weeks from start to initial submission, with an additional 1-2 weeks for review and launch.

Key success factors:
1. Complete all critical fixes before TWA generation
2. Thorough testing across target device matrix  
3. High-quality store listing with professional assets
4. Proactive monitoring and rapid response to issues

The app has strong fundamentals with clean architecture, security-conscious implementation, and solid PWA foundation. With the identified fixes implemented, MatchOps Local should have a smooth path to Play Store approval.
### Play Policy Considerations

- If distributing as a TWA and selling in‑app digital goods, Play Billing is required; external payment links are not allowed.
- Alternative: Use a paid Play listing (one‑time purchase to install) and avoid in‑app purchases.
- Ensure Privacy Policy and Terms are linked in the store listing and app.
