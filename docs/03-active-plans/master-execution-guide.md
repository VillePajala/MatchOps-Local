## Phase 0: Scope Freeze and Owners

- Owner: TBD
- Target Date: TBD

Outcome: locked MVP scope for Play Store release; each task below has a named owner and target date.

- Define MVP scope for v1 (features toggled on/off at launch).
- Assign owners for each section in PRODUCTION_READINESS_FIX_PLAN.md.
- Convert this guide’s bullets into GitHub issues with labels: `production-readiness`, `store`, `monetization`.

---

## Execution Workflow (Branches, PRs, Checklists)

- One step per PR: keep changes small and isolated to a single checklist item.
- Branch naming: `feat/<phase>-<short-task>`, e.g., `feat/m0-jest-green`.
- PR discipline:
  - Link the relevant checklist item and issue.
  - Include acceptance checks in the PR description.
  - After merge, tick the checkbox in this guide (and the related issue), then pick the next item.
- Never bundle multiple critical items in the same PR.

Checklist Legend
- [ ] Not started  • [x] Done  • [~] In progress (use temporarily in PR text, not here)

## Phase M0: Pre‑Migration Essentials (Tests, Logging, Sentry, PWA dedup)

- Owner: TBD
- Target Date: TBD

Outcome: reduce migration risk with trustworthy tests and basic observability; remove sources of noise.

- M0 Checklist
  - [x] Tests: fix JSDOM `window.location` cleanup error; ensure Jest suite is green (FIX_PLAN §8)
  - [ ] Tests: stabilize a core E2E path (start → new game → save → load) per testing/E2E_TESTING_GUIDE.md [SKIPPED FOR LATER]
  - [x] Logging: replace stray `console.*` with `logger` (FIX_PLAN §4)
  - [x] Monitoring: add minimal `@sentry/nextjs` with staging/dev DSN (FIX_PLAN §5)
  - [x] Analytics (optional early): gate `<Analytics />` to production env to reduce noise (FIX_PLAN §6)
  - [x] PWA: render `ServiceWorkerRegistration` and `InstallPrompt` only once (FIX_PLAN §3)
  - [x] i18n: ensure only one `I18nInitializer` wraps the app (no duplication)

Note (optional): You may pre‑apply minimal SW changes now — remove `'/'` from pre‑cache and reduce logs — but leave the full hardening (versioned cleanup, cache policy) to Phase P1.

Acceptance
- Jest + core E2E path green locally.
- Logging routed via `logger`; console noise minimized.
- Basic Sentry events captured in staging/dev.
- Only one SW registration/prompt.

---

## Phase M1: IndexedDB Foundation ✅ COMPLETED

- Owner: Completed
- Completion Date: September 30, 2025

Outcome: Storage abstraction implemented with async operations, error handling, type safety, and comprehensive application integration. IndexedDB foundation is live; current production builds run on IndexedDB via the same abstraction (localStorage is retained only as a read-only backup snapshot).

### M1A: Storage Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] IndexedDB KV adapter and storage foundation
  - ✅ Created `StorageAdapter` interface with error handling
  - ✅ Implemented `IndexedDBKvAdapter` with full test suite
  - ✅ Implemented migration system with cross-tab coordination
  - ✅ Fixed critical race conditions and memory leaks
  - ✅ Added comprehensive storage infrastructure (storageMetrics, storageMutex, storageRecovery, storageBootstrap, storageConfigManager)

### M1B: Storage Abstraction Integration ✅ COMPLETED
**All Work Completed in Single Comprehensive Implementation**:
- ✅ **Storage Helper**: `src/utils/storage.ts` — async operations behind a unified interface
- ✅ **Abstraction Ready**: StorageFactory supports IndexedDB and localStorage
- ✅ **Utility Integration**: Core utilities use the abstraction (savedGames, masterRoster, appSettings, seasons, tournaments, teams, playerAdjustments, fullBackup)
- ✅ **Component Integration**: Updated i18n.ts, useGameTimer.ts, HomePage.tsx
- ✅ **Error Logging**: Added error logging to all empty catch blocks
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: 140+ tests passing with proper async patterns
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compliance across application
- ℹ️ **Current Backend**: IndexedDB (localStorage retained only for backup/migration data)

**Implementation Note**: The IndexedDB foundation is active; current builds default to IndexedDB with automatic migration on first load (localStorage copy is intentionally preserved for rollback and forensic recovery).

### M1C: Data Migration ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: Completed — one-time migration now runs automatically on every app start (`runMigration()` in `src/app/page.tsx`) to move any legacy localStorage data into IndexedDB. Legacy localStorage entries remain as a read-only safety net for recovery and forensic comparisons.
**Purpose**: Convert existing localStorage data to IndexedDB while keeping a redundant snapshot for rollback scenarios
**Implementation**: Automatic migration executes on first load (and no-ops afterward), updates `StorageConfig` to `mode: 'indexedDB'`, and intentionally preserves the localStorage copy for backups/diagnostics

Acceptance Criteria (for IndexedDB rollout)
- [x] App runs entirely on IndexedDB with no localStorage backend
- [x] Storage operations use async patterns with proper error handling
- [x] All tests pass with IndexedDB backend
- [x] Code audit passes: no direct localStorage outside dedicated migration/backup utilities
- [x] Build successful with no TypeScript or ESLint errors
- [x] Components and utilities fully integrated

**Next Step**: Maintain migration tooling for manual triggers (Settings → Storage) and monitor logs; no additional rollout work required unless we reintroduce a localStorage mode.

### M1D: Data Integrity - Linked Entities ✅ COMPLETED

- Completion Date: October 5, 2025
- Design Document: `docs/09-design/linked-entities-and-game-sync.md`

**Outcome**: Fixed name inconsistency bug where renamed teams/seasons/tournaments showed different names across UI. Implemented live entity name resolution with graceful fallbacks.

**What We Implemented** (Phase 1):
- [x] Fixed backup system to include teams (`TEAMS_INDEX_KEY`, `TEAM_ROSTERS_KEY`)
- [x] Created `entityLookup` utility for O(1) entity name resolution
- [x] Updated LoadGameModal to use live entity names via memoized maps
- [x] Graceful fallback to snapshot names for deleted entities
- [x] Cross-device import/export now preserves entity names correctly
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage (entityLookup.test.ts, fullBackup.test.ts)

**Deferred Features** (may be future work):
- Per-game team name overrides - Solving a problem that doesn't exist at current scale
- Settings sync (periods, duration, etc.) - No evidence users change mid-season
- Sync timestamps and "New settings available" prompts - Over-engineering for single-user PWA
- Bulk-apply tools - Manual updates acceptable for ~50-100 games

**Why Deferred**: Local-first PWA design principles favor simplicity over premature optimization. These features add complexity without validated user need. If future feedback indicates they're necessary, implementation path is documented in design doc.

**Implementation Files**:
- `src/utils/entityLookup.ts` - Name resolution utility (~63 lines)
- `src/utils/entityLookup.test.ts` - Comprehensive tests (~199 lines)
- `src/components/LoadGameModal.tsx` - Updated to use entity lookups
- `src/utils/fullBackup.ts` - Fixed to include teams in backups

**Acceptance**:
- ✅ All tests pass (18/18 new tests)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean
- ✅ ESLint passes with no warnings
- ✅ Backup/restore includes teams and rosters
- ✅ Renamed entities reflect immediately in UI
- ✅ Deleted entities show last known name (no crashes)
