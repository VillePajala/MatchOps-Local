## Phase 0: Scope Freeze and Owners

- Owner: TBD
- Target Date: TBD

Outcome: locked MVP scope for Play Store release; each task below has a named owner and target date.

- Define MVP scope for v1 (features toggled on/off at launch).
- Assign owners for each section in PRODUCTION_READINESS_FIX_PLAN.md.
- Convert this guide‚Äôs bullets into GitHub issues with labels: `production-readiness`, `store`, `monetization`.

---

## Execution Workflow (Branches, PRs, Checklists)

- One step per PR: keep changes small and isolated to a single checklist item.
- Branch naming: `feat/<phase>-<short-task>`, e.g., `feat/m0-jest-green`.
- PR discipline:
  - Link the relevant checklist item and issue.
  - Include acceptance checks in the PR description.
  - After merge, tick the checkbox in this guide (and the related issue), then pick the next item.
- Never bundle multiple critical items in the same PR.

## Phase M0: Pre‚ÄëMigration Essentials (Tests, Logging, Sentry, PWA dedup)

- Owner: TBD
- Target Date: TBD

Outcome: reduce migration risk with trustworthy tests and basic observability; remove sources of noise.

- M0 Checklist
  - [x] Tests: fix JSDOM `window.location` cleanup error; ensure Jest suite is green (FIX_PLAN ¬ß8)
  - [ ] Tests: stabilize a core E2E path (start ‚Üí new game ‚Üí save ‚Üí load) per testing/E2E_TESTING_GUIDE.md [SKIPPED FOR LATER]
  - [x] Logging: replace stray `console.*` with `logger` (FIX_PLAN ¬ß4)
  - [x] Monitoring: add minimal `@sentry/nextjs` with staging/dev DSN (FIX_PLAN ¬ß5)
  - [x] Analytics (optional early): gate `<Analytics />` to production env to reduce noise (FIX_PLAN ¬ß6)
  - [x] PWA: render `ServiceWorkerRegistration` and `InstallPrompt` only once (FIX_PLAN ¬ß3)
  - [x] i18n: ensure only one `I18nInitializer` wraps the app (no duplication)

Note (optional): You may pre‚Äëapply minimal SW changes now ‚Äî remove `'/'` from pre‚Äëcache and reduce logs ‚Äî but leave the full hardening (versioned cleanup, cache policy) to Phase P1.

Acceptance
- Jest + core E2E path green locally.
- Logging routed via `logger`; console noise minimized.
- Basic Sentry events captured in staging/dev.
- Only one SW registration/prompt.

## Phase M1: IndexedDB Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- Owner: Completed
- Completion Date: September 30, 2025

Outcome: Storage abstraction implemented with async operations, error handling, type safety, and comprehensive application integration. IndexedDB foundation exists; current production backend uses localStorage via the same abstraction.

### M1A: Storage Infrastructure ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] IndexedDB KV adapter and storage foundation
  - ‚úÖ Created `StorageAdapter` interface with error handling
  - ‚úÖ Implemented `IndexedDBKvAdapter` with full test suite
  - ‚úÖ Implemented migration system with cross-tab coordination
  - ‚úÖ Fixed critical race conditions and memory leaks
  - ‚úÖ Added comprehensive storage infrastructure (storageMetrics, storageMutex, storageRecovery, storageBootstrap, storageConfigManager)

### M1B: Storage Abstraction Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**All Work Completed in Single Comprehensive Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ **Storage Helper**: `src/utils/storage.ts` ‚Äî async operations behind a unified interface
- ‚úÖ **Abstraction Ready**: StorageFactory supports IndexedDB and localStorage
- ‚úÖ **Utility Integration**: Core utilities use the abstraction (savedGames, masterRoster, appSettings, seasons, tournaments, teams, playerAdjustments, fullBackup)
- ‚úÖ **Component Integration**: Updated i18n.ts, useGameTimer.ts, HomePage.tsx
- ‚úÖ **Error Logging**: Added error logging to all empty catch blocks
- ‚úÖ **Test Coverage**: 140+ tests passing with proper async patterns
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compliance across application
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Current Backend**: localStorage (IndexedDB can be enabled in future rollout)

**Implementation Note**: The IndexedDB foundation branch is available; current builds default to localStorage for maximum compatibility.

### M1C: Data Migration (Planned)
**Status**: Planned ‚Äî one-time migration utility available in foundation work; not enabled by default
**Purpose**: Convert existing localStorage data to IndexedDB when/if the IndexedDB backend is enabled
**Implementation**: Migration runs automatically on first app load (when enabled), then localStorage is cleared

Acceptance Criteria (for IndexedDB rollout)
- [ ] App runs entirely on IndexedDB with no localStorage backend
- [ ] Storage operations use async patterns with proper error handling
- [ ] All tests pass with IndexedDB backend
- [ ] Code audit passes: no direct localStorage outside adapters
- [ ] Build successful with no TypeScript or ESLint errors
- [ ] Components and utilities fully integrated

**Next Step**: Evaluate enabling IndexedDB behind a feature flag, complete migration rollout plan, and run staged rollout

### M1D: Data Integrity - Linked Entities ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- Completion Date: October 5, 2025
- Design Document: `docs/09-design/linked-entities-and-game-sync.md`

**Outcome**: Fixed name inconsistency bug where renamed teams/seasons/tournaments showed different names across UI. Implemented live entity name resolution with graceful fallbacks.

**What We Implemented** (Phase 1):
- [x] Fixed backup system to include teams (`TEAMS_INDEX_KEY`, `TEAM_ROSTERS_KEY`)
- [x] Created `entityLookup` utility for O(1) entity name resolution
- [x] Updated LoadGameModal to use live entity names via memoized maps
- [x] Graceful fallback to snapshot names for deleted entities
- [x] Cross-device import/export now preserves entity names correctly
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage (entityLookup.test.ts, fullBackup.test.ts)

**Deferred Features** (may be future work):
- Per-game team name overrides - Solving a problem that doesn't exist at current scale
- Settings sync (periods, duration, etc.) - No evidence users change mid-season
- Sync timestamps and "New settings available" prompts - Over-engineering for single-user PWA
- Bulk-apply tools - Manual updates acceptable for ~50-100 games

**Why Deferred**: Local-first PWA design principles favor simplicity over premature optimization. These features add complexity without validated user need. If future feedback indicates they're necessary, implementation path is documented in design doc.

**Implementation Files**:
- `src/utils/entityLookup.ts` - Name resolution utility (~63 lines)
- `src/utils/entityLookup.test.ts` - Comprehensive tests (~199 lines)
- `src/components/LoadGameModal.tsx` - Updated to use entity lookups
- `src/utils/fullBackup.ts` - Fixed to include teams in backups

**Acceptance**:
- ‚úÖ All tests pass (18/18 new tests)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation clean
- ‚úÖ ESLint passes with no warnings
- ‚úÖ Backup/restore includes teams and rosters
- ‚úÖ Renamed entities reflect immediately in UI
- ‚úÖ Deleted entities show last known name (no crashes)

## Phase F1: Backend Architecture Evolution (Planned)

- Owner: TBD
- Target Date: TBD
- Estimated Duration: 16-24 weeks (4-6 months)
- Complexity: High
- Documentation: `backend-evolution/` folder

**Overview**: Evolve from IndexedDB-only to dual-backend architecture supporting both local (free) and cloud (premium) modes.

**Business Context**:
- **Free Tier**: Local mode (IndexedDB), full features, single device
- **Premium Tier**: Cloud mode (Supabase PostgreSQL), multi-device sync, cloud backup, in-app purchase

**Technical Approach**:
- Introduce `DataStore` and `AuthService` interfaces
- Wrap existing IndexedDB code in `LocalDataStore` (no rewrites)
- Implement `SupabaseDataStore` for cloud backend
- User-initiated migration from local to cloud

**Key Documentation**:
- **Architecture**: [Dual-Backend Architecture](../02-technical/architecture/dual-backend-architecture.md)
- **Interfaces**: [DataStore Interface](../02-technical/architecture/datastore-interface.md) | [AuthService Interface](../02-technical/architecture/auth-service-interface.md)
- **Database**: [Current Storage Schema](../02-technical/database/current-storage-schema.md) | [Supabase Schema](../02-technical/database/supabase-schema.md)
- **Migration**: [Migration Strategy](./backend-evolution/migration-strategy.md)
- **Roadmap**: [Phased Implementation Roadmap](./backend-evolution/phased-implementation-roadmap.md) ‚ö° **START HERE**

**Implementation Phases**:

### Phase F1.1: Interfaces & Local Wrapper (4-6 weeks)
- [ ] Define DataStore and AuthService interfaces
- [ ] Implement LocalDataStore (wraps existing storage code)
- [ ] Implement LocalAuthService (no-op)
- [ ] Update React Query hooks to use DataStore
- [ ] All tests pass, zero functionality changes

**Acceptance**: Same functionality, new abstraction layer

### Phase F1.2: Supabase Implementation (6-8 weeks)
