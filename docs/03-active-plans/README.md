# Active Plans & Current Status

⭐ **START HERE for current execution plans and project status**

Primary plan: `docs/03-active-plans/MICRO-REFactor-ROADMAP.md`

This micro‑step roadmap replaces big‑bang refactors. We will execute Layers 1–3 in small, test‑gated steps. After each step, manually test before proceeding.

This directory contains all active execution plans, current status, and roadmaps. These are the living documents that guide day-to-day development.
