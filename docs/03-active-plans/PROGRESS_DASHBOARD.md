## 🎯 **Phase P1: Security & Service Worker Hardening**

**Status**: 🟡 **READY TO START**
**Target Start**: Now
**Estimated Time**: 3-5 hours
**Owner**: Unassigned

### Tasks Remaining

#### 1. Security Headers & CSP (1-2 hours)

- [ ] Configure local-first appropriate CSP (Play Store + Sentry)
- [ ] Add basic security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Gate Sentry/Play Store origins with env flags
- [ ] Verify headers in DevTools

**Files**: `next.config.ts`
**Reference**: `production-readiness.md` §1, `security.md`

#### 2. Service Worker Hardening (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Implement versioned cache naming
- [ ] Remove `'/'` from pre-cache list
- [ ] Add cache cleanup on activate
- [ ] Implement network-first for HTML documents
- [ ] Implement cache-first for static assets
- [ ] Reduce production logging
- [ ] Test offline behavior

**Files**: `public/sw.js`, `scripts/generate-manifest.mjs`
**Reference**: `production-readiness.md` §2

#### 3. Verification (30 minutes)
- [ ] Build and test locally (`npm run build && npm run start`)
- [ ] Verify security headers present
- [ ] Check cache behavior
- [ ] Test offline/online transitions
- [ ] Verify no CSP violations

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Security headers visible on all routes
- ✅ No unexpected CSP violations
- ✅ Service Worker caches static assets only
- ✅ Old caches removed on update
- ✅ Offline functionality works
- ✅ No stale HTML served

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS - Decision Point**

### 🔴 **CRITICAL DECISION REQUIRED**

You have completed all major features but stand at a fork in the road. Choose your path:

### **Option 1: Fix Critical Technical Debt First** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
**Time**: 4-5 hours
**Impact**: 3-5x faster development forever
**ROI**: 1000% over project lifetime

**Why This Matters**:
- HomePage.tsx: 3,725 lines (~9.3x too large)
- GameSettingsModal.tsx: 1,995 lines (~5x too large)
- Every new feature currently takes 3-5x longer than it should
- Testing is extremely difficult
- Onboarding new developers nearly impossible

**Start Here**: `docs/CRITICAL_FIXES_REQUIRED.md` → `docs/05-development/fix-plans/P0-HomePage-Refactoring-Plan.md`

**After Completion**: All future work (including P1-P5) becomes 3-5x faster

### **Option 2: Production Readiness P1 (Security & Service Worker)**
**Time**: 3-5 hours
**Impact**: Security improvements, better offline experience
**Risk**: Technical debt makes P2-P5 slower and more painful

**Start Here**: `production-readiness.md` §1-2

### **Option 3: Add Team Final Positions Feature**
**Time**: 6-8 hours (will take longer due to technical debt)
**Impact**: New user-facing feature
**Risk**: Makes technical debt worse, compounds future slowdown

**Start Here**: `team-final-positions-plan.md`

### 📊 **Recommendation Matrix**

| Priority | Choose Option |
|----------|---------------|
| **Long-term sustainability** | 1️⃣ Fix debt first |
| **Need Play Store ASAP** | 2️⃣ P1, then fix debt during P2-P5 |
| **Want new features visible to users** | ⚠️ Not recommended (fix debt first for sanity) |

### ⚡ **Quick Decision Guide**

**If you have 2+ weeks**: Fix debt → P1 → P2-P5 (smooth, fast, maintainable)
**If you have days**: P1 → P2-P5 → Fix debt (painful but possible)
**If you're planning to maintain long-term**: Fix debt is non-negotiable
