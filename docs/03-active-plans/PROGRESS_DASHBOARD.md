## ✅ **Phase M0: Pre-Migration Essentials**

**Status**: ✅ **80% COMPLETE** (6 of 7 tasks done, 1 deferred)
**Completion Date**: September 2025
**Time Spent**: ~8 hours

### Completed Tasks ✅
- [x] Jest suite stabilized (window.location cleanup fixed)
- [x] Logging normalized (replaced console.* with logger)
- [x] Sentry monitoring added (staging/dev DSN configured)
- [x] Analytics gated (production-only via env flag)
- [x] PWA components deduplicated (ServiceWorkerRegistration, InstallPrompt)
- [x] i18n initialization deduplicated (single I18nInitializer)

### Deferred Tasks
- [ ] E2E test stabilization (core path: start → new game → save → load)
  - **Reason**: Deferred to Phase P3 (Quality Gates)
  - **Status**: Marked [SKIPPED FOR LATER]

**Reference**: `master-execution-guide.md` Phase M0

## ✅ **Phase M1: IndexedDB Foundation**

**Status**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE**
**Completion Date**: September 30, 2025
**Time Spent**: ~15 hours (originally estimated 25+ hours, simplified to 6-7 hours)

### What Was Accomplished

#### M1A: Storage Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Created `StorageAdapter` interface with error handling
- [x] Implemented `IndexedDBKvAdapter` with full test suite
- [x] Migration system with cross-tab coordination
- [x] Fixed critical race conditions and memory leaks
- [x] Comprehensive storage infrastructure (metrics, mutex, recovery, bootstrap, config)

#### M1B: IndexedDB-Only Storage ✅
- [x] Storage helper created (`src/utils/storage.ts` - 877 lines)
- [x] localStorage elimination (removed all fallbacks from storageFactory)
- [x] All 8 utility files converted (savedGames, masterRoster, appSettings, seasons, tournaments, teams, playerAdjustments, fullBackup)
- [x] Component integration (i18n.ts, useGameTimer.ts, HomePage.tsx)
- [x] Error logging added to all empty catch blocks
- [x] 144+ tests passing with async patterns
- [x] Full TypeScript compliance
- [x] Code verification (no localStorage outside tests/adapters)

#### M1C: Data Migration ✅
- [x] One-time migration utility implemented and tested
- [x] Migration system with rollback capability
- [x] Cross-tab coordination working

### Key Achievement
**Simplified from 19-25 hours to 6-7 hours** by discovering existing infrastructure and avoiding over-engineering.

## 🎯 **Phase P1: Security & Service Worker Hardening**

**Status**: 🟡 **READY TO START**
**Target Start**: Now
**Estimated Time**: 3-5 hours
**Owner**: Unassigned

### Tasks Remaining

#### 1. Security Headers & CSP (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Add CSP headers to `next.config.ts`
- [ ] Configure local-first appropriate CSP (Play Store + Sentry)
- [ ] Add basic security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Gate Sentry/Play Store origins with env flags
- [ ] Verify headers in DevTools

**Files**: `next.config.ts`
**Reference**: `production-readiness.md` §1, `security.md`

#### 2. Service Worker Hardening (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Implement versioned cache naming
- [ ] Remove `'/'` from pre-cache list
- [ ] Add cache cleanup on activate
- [ ] Implement network-first for HTML documents
- [ ] Implement cache-first for static assets
- [ ] Reduce production logging
- [ ] Test offline behavior

**Files**: `public/sw.js`, `scripts/generate-manifest.mjs`
**Reference**: `production-readiness.md` §2

#### 3. Verification (30 minutes)
- [ ] Build and test locally (`npm run build && npm run start`)
- [ ] Verify security headers present
- [ ] Check cache behavior
- [ ] Test offline/online transitions
- [ ] Verify no CSP violations

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Security headers visible on all routes
- ✅ No unexpected CSP violations
- ✅ Service Worker caches static assets only
- ✅ Old caches removed on update
- ✅ Offline functionality works
- ✅ No stale HTML served
