# Component Refactoring Plan

This document tracks the refactoring of oversized components in the soccer coaching application to improve maintainability, testability, and developer experience.

## Overview

### Problem Statement
Several components have grown to unmanageable sizes:
- `HomePage.tsx`: 2,802 lines (critical)
- `GameStatsModal.tsx`: 1,469 lines (critical) 
- `GameSettingsModal.tsx`: 1,465 lines (critical)
- `SoccerField.tsx`: 1,125 lines (should address)

### Goals
- Reduce component sizes to 200-500 lines (ideal) or 500-1000 lines (acceptable)
- Improve code maintainability and readability
- Enable better testing strategies
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Follow React best practices and single responsibility principle
