# Phase 2 Branch 1: Migration Control

## Overview
This branch implements user control features for the IndexedDB migration, allowing users to pause, resume, cancel, and preview migrations.

## Features Being Implemented

### 1. Pause/Resume Functionality
- Users can pause migration at any point
- State is persisted to sessionStorage
- Migration can resume from exact pause point
- Checkpoint system every 50 items

### 2. Cancel Operation
- Graceful cancellation with proper cleanup
- Automatic rollback to pre-migration state
- Backup restoration if needed
- Clear user feedback about cancellation status

### 3. Pre-Migration Estimation
- Calculate total data size before starting
- Estimate migration duration based on sampling
- Show storage requirements
- Confidence level based on sample size

### 4. Migration Preview (Dry Run)
- Test migration without actual data transfer
- Validate API compatibility
- Check storage availability
- Identify potential issues before starting

## Implementation Status

- [x] Configuration constants added
- [x] Type definitions created
- [ ] Core control logic implementation
- [ ] UI components for control buttons
- [ ] Progress persistence mechanism
- [ ] Estimation algorithm
- [ ] Tests for all features

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/types/migrationControl.ts` - Type definitions
- `src/utils/migrationControlManager.ts` - Core control logic (TODO)
- `src/components/MigrationControlPanel.tsx` - UI controls (TODO)
- `src/hooks/useMigrationControl.ts` - React hook (TODO)

### Modified Files
- `src/config/migrationConfig.ts` - Added control feature flags
- `src/utils/indexedDbMigration.ts` - Add pause points (TODO)
- `src/components/MigrationStatus.tsx` - Add control buttons (TODO)

## Testing Plan

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Pause/resume state management
   - Estimation accuracy
   - Cancellation cleanup

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Full pause/resume cycle
   - Cancel at various stages
   - Preview accuracy

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Browser refresh during pause
   - Multiple pause/resume cycles
   - Cancel during error state

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can pause and resume migration without data loss
- [ ] Cancel operation fully cleans up and restores previous state
- [ ] Estimation is within 20% of actual time
- [ ] Preview accurately predicts migration success
- [ ] All features work on mobile devices
- [ ] No memory leaks from control operations

## Next Steps

1. Implement core control manager
2. Add pause points to migration orchestrator
3. Create UI components
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation
