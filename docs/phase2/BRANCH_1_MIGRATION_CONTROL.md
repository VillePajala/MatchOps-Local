# Phase 2 Branch 1: Migration Control ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Overview
This branch implements user control features for the IndexedDB migration, allowing users to pause, resume, cancel, and preview migrations. **All features are now production-ready with comprehensive testing and enterprise-grade reliability.**

## Features Implemented ✅

### 1. Pause/Resume Functionality ✅
- ✅ Users can pause migration at any point
- ✅ State is persisted to localStorage with data integrity protection
- ✅ Migration can resume from exact pause point with checksum verification
- ✅ Checkpoint system configurable (default: every 10 items)
- ✅ Tab coordination prevents concurrent migrations
- ✅ Memory leak prevention with operation queue limits

### 2. Cancel Operation ✅
- ✅ Graceful cancellation with proper cleanup
- ✅ Automatic rollback to pre-migration state with batch processing
- ✅ Granular error handling during rollback operations
- ✅ Clear user feedback about cancellation status
- ✅ Force cleanup on tab close or browser refresh

### 3. Pre-Migration Estimation ✅
- ✅ Calculate total data size before starting
- ✅ Estimate migration duration based on adaptive sampling
- ✅ Show storage requirements and memory availability
- ✅ Statistical confidence levels (high/medium/low) based on sample size
- ✅ Memory pressure detection and adaptive strategies
- ✅ Stratified sampling for better data representation

### 4. Migration Preview (Dry Run) ✅
- ✅ Test migration without actual data transfer
- ✅ Validate API compatibility (IndexedDB, localStorage, Web Crypto)
- ✅ Check storage availability and quota
- ✅ Identify potential issues before starting
- ✅ Browser compatibility warnings with specific recommendations
- ✅ Memory usage analysis and warnings

### 5. Enterprise-Grade Enhancements ✅
- ✅ **Tab Coordination**: Mutex-based locking with heartbeat mechanism
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: SHA-256 checksums for resume data verification
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive fallback strategies for all failure modes
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Intelligent queue limits and cleanup mechanisms
- ✅ **Browser Compatibility**: Detailed warnings and graceful degradation
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: 10 operations per minute to prevent system overload

## Implementation Status ✅

### 3. Edge Cases ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ **Browser refresh during pause** - State recovery and corruption handling
- ✅ **Multiple pause/resume cycles** - Stress testing with repeated operations
- ✅ **Cancel during error state** - Graceful cancellation during failures
- ✅ **Concurrent operations** - Race condition prevention and handling
- ✅ **Large datasets** - Performance with 50,000+ items
- ✅ **Storage quota exceeded** - Graceful degradation when storage is full

### 4. Performance & Stress Testing ✅ **COMPLETED**
