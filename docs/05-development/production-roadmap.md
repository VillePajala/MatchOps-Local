**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Planned  
**Priority**: High  
**Target Completion**: Q4 2025  
**Assigned**: Development Team

## Overview

Based on the comprehensive production readiness assessment, this document outlines the implementation plan for the four key recommendations to bring MatchOps-Local to full production readiness.

**Current Production Readiness Score**: 85-90%  
**Target Score After Implementation**: 95%+

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Security & Dependencies (Week 1-2)
### Phase 2: Error Monitoring (Week 2-3)  
### Phase 3: Environment Configuration (Week 3-4)
### Phase 4: Bundle Optimization (Week 4-5)

## 1. ðŸ”’ **Security: Fix npm audit vulnerabilities**

**Status**: ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days  

### Problem Statement
Currently 107 critical npm audit vulnerabilities exist, primarily in Jest/Babel dev dependencies. While these don't affect production runtime, they pose security risks in the development environment.

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1A: Dependency Analysis (2 hours)
- [ ] Run detailed `npm audit` analysis to categorize vulnerabilities
- [ ] Identify which are dev vs production dependencies  
- [ ] Research latest stable versions for major vulnerable packages
- [ ] Create compatibility matrix for Jest ecosystem updates

#### Phase 1B: Selective Updates (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Update Jest to latest stable version (29.x â†’ 30.x if available)
- [ ] Update Babel ecosystem packages (@babel/core, etc.)
- [ ] Update Testing Library packages
- [ ] Update other vulnerable dev dependencies

#### Phase 1C: Testing & Validation (2-4 hours)
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no breaking changes
- [ ] Update test configurations if necessary
- [ ] Verify build process still works
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline if needed

#### Files to Modify:
```
package.json - Update vulnerable dependencies
.npmrc - Add audit configuration for production
jest.config.js - Update if breaking changes occur
.github/workflows/ci.yml - Update if needed
```

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Zero critical vulnerabilities in `npm audit`
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Build process works correctly
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline successful

## 2. ðŸ“Š **Monitoring: Add Sentry error tracking**

**Status**: ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

### Problem Statement
Currently no production error monitoring exists. Need real-time error tracking, performance monitoring, and user feedback collection for production deployments.

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 2A: Sentry Setup (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Create Sentry account/project for MatchOps-Local
- [ ] Install `@sentry/nextjs` package
- [ ] Configure basic Sentry integration
- [ ] Set up environment-specific DSN keys

#### Phase 2B: Error Boundary Integration (2-3 hours)  
- [ ] Enhance existing ErrorBoundary component with Sentry reporting
- [ ] Add user context (anonymous session data)
- [ ] Implement error fingerprinting for better grouping
- [ ] Add user feedback dialog for error reports

#### Phase 2C: Performance Monitoring (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Configure Core Web Vitals tracking
- [ ] Add custom performance metrics for key user flows
- [ ] Set up transaction tracking for game operations
- [ ] Configure release tracking

#### Phase 2D: Production Configuration (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Environment-based Sentry activation (production only)
- [ ] Configure sample rates and filters
- [ ] Set up alerts for critical errors
- [ ] Test error reporting in staging environment

#### Files to Create/Modify:
```
src/lib/sentry.ts - Sentry configuration
src/app/layout.tsx - Initialize Sentry 
next.config.ts - Add Sentry webpack plugin
src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx - Enhanced error reporting
package.json - Add Sentry dependency
.env.example - Add Sentry DSN variables
```

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Sentry captures and reports errors in production
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] User feedback collection working  
- [ ] No impact on development environment
- [ ] Error grouping and alerts configured
