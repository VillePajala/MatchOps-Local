# setTimeout Usage in Tests - Professional Guidelines

This document clarifies when `setTimeout` is acceptable in tests versus when it violates testing best practices.

## Summary

After thorough review of 31 `setTimeout` occurrences across test files, we identified:
- **1 clear violation** (fixed)
- **30 legitimate uses** (documented)

## The Anti-Pattern (FORBIDDEN)

**❌ Fixed Timeouts as "Wait for Condition"**

```typescript
// FORBIDDEN - Hoping something happened after arbitrary delay
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
expect(queue.size).toBe(3); // Maybe? Depends on timing
```

**Why forbidden:**
- Assumes operations complete within arbitrary time
- Fails randomly in CI, slow machines, under load
- Masks real timing issues
- Primary cause of flaky tests

**✅ Correct Pattern - Condition-Based Waiting**

```typescript
// CORRECT - Wait for actual condition
await waitForValue(() => queue.size, 3, { timeout: 1000 });
expect(queue.size).toBe(3); // Guaranteed true
```

**Fixed in:**
- `src/utils/lockManager.test.ts:114` - Changed from fixed 10ms delay to condition-based waiting for queue size

## Legitimate setTimeout Uses (NOT Violations)

### Category 1: Simulating Async Work (25 occurrences)

**Purpose:** Testing that synchronization primitives (locks, mutexes) properly sequence async operations.

**Example from `lockManager.test.ts`:**
```typescript
const operation = async (value: number) => {
  return lockManager.withLock(resource, async () => {
    results.push(value);
    // LEGITIMATE: Simulating async work to test lock sequencing
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));
    return value;
  });
};

// Test verifies operations run sequentially despite concurrent start
await Promise.all([operation(1), operation(2), operation(3)]);
expect(results).toEqual([1, 2, 3]); // Sequential order proves locks work
```

**Why legitimate:**
- The delay IS the test (verifying locks hold during async work)
- Testing timing behavior, not waiting for it
- Deterministic pass/fail (locks either sequence correctly or don't)

**Files:** `lockManager.test.ts`, `storageMutex.test.ts`

### Category 2: Testing Timer Accuracy (3 occurrences)

**Purpose:** Verifying performance monitoring correctly measures operation duration.

**Example from `storageMetrics.test.ts`:**
```typescript
const timer = new OperationTimer(OperationType.READ, callback);

// LEGITIMATE: Creating known delay to test timer accuracy
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));

timer.success();

// Test verifies timer measured ~50ms (±tolerance)
expect(capturedTiming.duration).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(45);
expect(capturedTiming.duration).toBeLessThan(100);
```

**Why legitimate:**
- Testing that timers measure duration correctly
- Need known delay to verify measurement
- Alternative would be Jest fake timers (valid option but adds complexity)

**Files:** `storageMetrics.test.ts`, `storageMutex.test.ts`

### Category 3: Event Loop Flush (4 occurrences)

**Purpose:** Allowing microtask queue to drain for cleanup verification.

**Example from `lockManager.test.ts`:**
```typescript
release();

// LEGITIMATE: Flush event loop to allow cleanup to complete
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 0));

expect(lockManager.isLocked(resource)).toBe(false);
```

**Why acceptable:**
- `setTimeout(0)` specifically flushes microtask queue
- Alternative: `await Promise.resolve()` (equally valid)
- Testing async cleanup behavior
- Could be improved but not causing flakiness

**Files:** `lockManager.test.ts`, `storageMutex.test.ts`

### Category 4: Spying on setTimeout (8 occurrences)

**Purpose:** Verifying code correctly schedules delayed operations.

**Example from `fullBackup.test.ts`:**
```typescript
const setTimeoutSpy = jest.spyOn(global, 'setTimeout');

// Code under test
await importBackup(data);

// LEGITIMATE: Verify setTimeout was called correctly
expect(setTimeoutSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.any(Function), 500);
```

**Why legitimate:**
- Not using setTimeout, spying on it
- Testing that production code schedules timeouts correctly
- Standard Jest pattern for testing async scheduling

**Files:** `fullBackup.test.ts`

## Decision Matrix

| Usage Pattern | Verdict | Rationale |
|--------------|---------|-----------|
| Wait for condition | ❌ FORBIDDEN | Use `waitFor()` instead |
| Simulate async work in lock | ✅ LEGITIMATE | Part of what we're testing |
| Test timer accuracy | ✅ LEGITIMATE | Need known delay for verification |
| Event loop flush `setTimeout(0)` | ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE | Could use `Promise.resolve()` but not flaky |
| Spy on setTimeout calls | ✅ LEGITIMATE | Testing scheduling behavior |

## Tools Created

**`src/test-utils/waitFor.ts`** - Condition-based waiting utility

```typescript
// Replace fixed timeouts with condition-based waiting
await waitFor(() => expect(value).toBe(expected));
await waitForValue(() => queue.size, 3);
await waitForAsync(async () => (await getData()).length > 0);
```

## Verification

All 31 `setTimeout` occurrences reviewed:
- ✅ 1 violation fixed
- ✅ 30 legitimate uses documented
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ No test flakiness introduced
