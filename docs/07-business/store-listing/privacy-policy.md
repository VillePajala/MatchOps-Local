## Overview

MatchOps ("we", "our", "the app") is a local-first soccer coaching application. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information.

## Data Storage

### Local Data
All your data is stored locally on your device:
- Player rosters and information
- Game records and statistics
- Settings and preferences
- Season and tournament data

**We do not have access to this data.** It never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it.

### No Account Required
MatchOps works entirely offline. No account creation, login, or personal information is required to use the app.

## Data We May Collect

### Error Reporting (Optional)
When the app encounters an error, we may collect:
- Error type and stack trace
- Device type and OS version
- App version
- Anonymized session information

This helps us fix bugs and improve the app. Error reports:
- Do not contain your game data or player information
- Are processed by Sentry.io (see their privacy policy)
- Can be disabled in app settings

### Play Store License Validation
When you purchase premium features:
- Google Play handles all payment processing
- We verify license status through Play Store API
- We do not receive your payment information

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Names or personal details of players in your roster
- Game content, scores, or statistics
- Location data
- Photos or media
- Contact information
- Device identifiers for tracking

## Third-Party Services

### Google Play Store

- See Google's Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

### Sentry (Error Reporting)

## Your Rights

You can:

- **Delete your data** by clearing app data or uninstalling

## Children's Privacy

MatchOps does not knowingly collect information from children. The app stores player names locally as entered by the coach - these are controlled entirely by you and never transmitted to us.

## Data Security
