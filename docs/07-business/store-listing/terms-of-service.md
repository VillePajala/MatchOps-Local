## Agreement to Terms

By downloading, installing, or using MatchOps ("the app"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the app.

## Description of Service

MatchOps is a local-first soccer coaching application that helps coaches:
- Track game time and scores
- Manage player rosters
- Record player statistics
- Organize seasons and tournaments

By default, all data is stored locally on your device. Cloud sync is available as an optional Premium feature.

## License Grant

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use MatchOps for personal, non-commercial purposes in accordance with these terms.

You may NOT:
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the app
- Modify, adapt, or create derivative works
- Distribute, sublicense, or transfer the app to others
- Use the app for any illegal purpose
- Remove any copyright or proprietary notices

## User Responsibilities

You are responsible for:
- All data you enter into the app
- Maintaining backups of your data (using the export feature)
- Ensuring your use complies with applicable laws
- Any activity that occurs through your use of the app

## Data and Privacy

Your data is stored locally on your device (local mode) or in our secure cloud database (cloud mode with subscription). See our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) for details on data handling, security, GDPR rights, and what limited data we may collect.

### Data Security Acknowledgment
By using MatchOps, you acknowledge that:
- **Local mode**: Data is stored in your browser's IndexedDB without additional encryption beyond what your device provides
- **Device security**: Your device's access controls (screen lock, password, biometrics) are your primary protection for local data
- **Backup files**: Exported backup files contain unencrypted data and should be stored securely
- **Personnel data**: If you store personnel contact information (email, phone), it follows the same security model as other app data
- **Your responsibility**: You are responsible for protecting access to your device and backup files

For additional security, enable cloud sync which provides server-side encryption, encryption at rest, and row-level security.

## Premium Subscription

MatchOps Premium is an optional subscription that provides additional features:
- **Cloud Sync**: Access your data across multiple devices
- **Unlimited entities**: Unlimited players, teams, seasons, and tournaments
- **Priority support**

Subscriptions are billed through Google Play Store. See Google Play's terms for billing, cancellation, and refund policies.

You can cancel your subscription at any time through Google Play. After cancellation, you retain access until the end of your billing period.

If you cancel Premium, your cloud data remains accessible in read-only mode. You can export or delete it at any time. After 90 days of account inactivity following cancellation, cloud data may be deleted.

## Cloud Sync Terms

When you enable Cloud Sync:
- You retain ownership of all your data
- We strive for high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted access
- You are responsible for maintaining local backups of critical data
- We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data

You can delete all cloud data at any time from Settings. Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.

## Intellectual Property

MatchOps and all related trademarks, logos, and content are the property of the developer (Ville Pajala). You do not acquire any ownership rights by using the app.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE DEVELOPER BE LIABLE FOR:
- Any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages
- Loss of data, profits, or business opportunities
- Any damages arising from your use or inability to use the app

Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid for the app (if any).

## Data Loss

You acknowledge that:

## Termination

We may terminate or suspend your access to the app immediately, without notice, if you breach these terms. Upon termination, your license to use the app ends.

You can voluntarily delete your cloud account and data at any time from the Settings menu.

## Changes to Terms

We may update these terms when necessary. Material changes will update the "Last Updated" date and trigger a re-consent prompt for cloud mode users. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.

## Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These terms are governed by the laws of Finland, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising from these terms or your use of the app shall be resolved in the courts of Helsinki, Finland.

## Severability

If any provision of these terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in effect.

## Entire Agreement

These terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the app.
