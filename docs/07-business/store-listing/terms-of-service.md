**Last Updated**: January 2026

> **Hosted URL**: https://matchops.com/terms (use this URL for Play Store submission)

## Agreement to Terms

By downloading, installing, or using MatchOps ("the app"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the app.

## Description of Service

MatchOps is a local-first soccer coaching application that helps coaches:
- Track game time and scores
- Manage player rosters
- Record player statistics
- Organize seasons and tournaments

All data is stored locally on your device.

## License Grant

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use MatchOps for personal, non-commercial purposes in accordance with these terms.

You may NOT:
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the app
- Modify, adapt, or create derivative works
- Distribute, sublicense, or transfer the app to others
- Use the app for any illegal purpose
- Remove any copyright or proprietary notices

## User Responsibilities

You are responsible for:
- All data you enter into the app
- Maintaining backups of your data (using the export feature)
- Ensuring your use complies with applicable laws
- Any activity that occurs through your use of the app

## Data and Privacy

Your data is stored locally on your device (local mode) or in our secure cloud database (cloud mode with subscription). See our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) for details on data handling, security, and what limited data we may collect (error reports, license validation, consent records).

### Data Security Acknowledgment
By using MatchOps, you acknowledge that:
- **Local mode**: Data is stored in your browser's IndexedDB without additional encryption beyond what your device provides
- **Device security**: Your device's access controls (screen lock, password, biometrics) are your primary protection for local data
- **Backup files**: Exported backup files contain unencrypted data and should be stored securely
- **Personnel data**: If you store personnel contact information (email, phone), it follows the same security model as other app data
- **Your responsibility**: You are responsible for protecting access to your device and backup files

This is industry standard for local-first applications. For additional security, enable cloud sync which provides server-side encryption and row-level security.

## Intellectual Property

MatchOps and all related trademarks, logos, and content are the property of the developer. You do not acquire any ownership rights by using the app.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:
- MERCHANTABILITY
- FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
- NON-INFRINGEMENT
- ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY OF DATA

We do not warrant that:
- The app will meet your specific requirements
- The app will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free
- Results obtained from the app will be accurate or reliable

## Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE DEVELOPER BE LIABLE FOR:
- Any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages
- Loss of data, profits, or business opportunities
- Any damages arising from your use or inability to use the app

Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid for the app (if any).

## Data Loss

You acknowledge that:
- Data is stored locally on your device
- We are not responsible for data loss due to device failure, app uninstallation, or any other cause

We reserve the right to:
- Modify or discontinue the app at any time
- Update these terms with reasonable notice
- Add or remove features

## Termination

We may terminate or suspend your access to the app immediately, without notice, if you breach these terms. Upon termination, your license to use the app ends.

## Changes to Terms

We may update these terms occasionally. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms. Material changes will be noted by the "Last Updated" date.

## Governing Law

These terms are governed by the laws of Finland, without regard to conflict of law principles.

## Severability

If any provision of these terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in effect.

## Entire Agreement
