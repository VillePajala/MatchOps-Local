# Privacy-First Monetization Strategy

**Status**: Planning Document

## Core Principle

MatchOps-Local implements **privacy-compatible monetization** where premium features are gated, but user data always stays local.

---

## What "Privacy-First" Means for Monetization

### ‚úÖ What Stays Private (Always Local)

**User Game Data** - NEVER Transmitted:
- Game scores and statistics
- Player names and rosters
- Team configurations
- Game events and timestamps
- User preferences and settings
- All IndexedDB storage contents

**No Behavioral Tracking**:
- Feature usage patterns NOT collected
- User activity NOT monitored
- Navigation patterns NOT tracked
- Time spent in app NOT recorded
- Button clicks NOT logged

### üîó What Requires Network (Minimal)

**License Validation Only**:
- Play Store purchase verification
- License status check (active/expired)
- Purchase restoration
- **NOT SENT**: What features they use, when, or how

**Example Network Calls**:
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Acceptable: License check
const isPremium = await checkPlayStorePurchase();
// Response: true/false (premium status only)

// ‚ùå NEVER: Usage tracking
// We do NOT send: { feature: 'stats', timestamp: now }
```

## Monetization Model

### Free Tier

**Core Features** (Always Free):
- Basic game tracking
- Player roster (up to 20 players)
- Simple statistics
- 1 team management
- Basic tactics board
- Game timer and scoring
- Data backup/restore

**Limitations**:
- 20 player maximum
- 1 team only
- Basic statistics only
- Limited export options

### Premium Tier ($9.99 one-time purchase)

**Unlocked Features**:
- ‚úÖ Unlimited players
- ‚úÖ Unlimited teams
- ‚úÖ Advanced statistics & analytics
- ‚úÖ Custom reports
- ‚úÖ CSV/PDF export
- ‚úÖ Advanced tactics board features
- ‚úÖ Season/tournament management
- ‚úÖ Priority support

**How It Works**:
1. User purchases via Play Store
2. App validates purchase with Play Store API
3. License cached locally in IndexedDB
4. Premium features unlocked
5. Works offline after initial validation

## Technical Implementation

### License Validation Flow

```
User Opens App
    ‚Üì
Check Local License Cache
    ‚Üì
If Expired or Missing ‚Üí Check Play Store API
    ‚Üì
Cache Result Locally (7-day validity)
    ‚Üì
Enable/Disable Premium Features
    ‚Üì
Continue Offline (license cached)
```

### Network Communication

**Only These Endpoints**:
```javascript
// 1. Play Store Purchase Verification
POST https://play.google.com/api/purchase/verify
Body: { purchaseToken, productId }
Response: { valid: true/false, expiryDate: null }

// 2. Error Reporting (Opt-in only)
POST https://sentry.io/api/errors
Body: { error, stacktrace } // NO user data

// 3. PWA Updates (Standard)
GET https://your-domain.com/sw.js
Response: Service Worker script
```

**Never Sent**:
- Game data (scores, players)
- Feature usage ("user opened stats 5 times")
- User behavior patterns
- Device identifiers (beyond Play Store standard)

## Success Metrics (Privacy-Compatible)

- ‚úÖ Number of purchases (Play Store Console)
- ‚úÖ Refund rates (Play Store Console)
- ‚úÖ App crashes (Sentry, opt-in)
