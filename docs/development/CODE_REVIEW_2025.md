# Code Review 2025
MatchOps‑Local — Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript

Updated: September 2025

Overview
- Solid foundations: modular utils/hooks, React Query, clear types, robust migration + backup, PWA wrappers, and good i18n coverage. The “local-only features” docs were aligned to reflect actual implementation with repo‑relative references and correct storage keys.
- Key opportunities: small but impactful correctness fixes, targeted a11y improvements, performance tuning around autosave/history, and standardization.

Strengths
- Types: Centralized domain modeling in `src/types/` (teams, seasons, tournaments, adjustments).
- Data: LocalStorage accessors with logging; team rosters guarded via a lock manager; migration is idempotent with backup/rollback.
- UI: Start screen adapts via first‑time detection; comprehensive modals; control bar is organized; instructions/help content matches UI.
- i18n: Centralized resources in `src/i18n.ts` with `I18nInitializer` wrapper.
- Docs: `docs/local-only-features/*` reflect actual code flows and storage keys.

Key Findings (Grounded in Code)
- i18n initial language key mismatch
  - File: `src/i18n.ts:17`
  - Issue: Reads `'appSettings'` directly instead of `APP_SETTINGS_KEY` (`'soccerAppSettings'`). This can ignore actual saved language.
- Mixed i18n import paths
  - Files: `src/components/StartScreen.tsx:6`, `src/components/I18nInitializer.tsx:5`, `src/components/HomePage.tsx:26`
  - Issue: Some use `@/i18n`, some use `../i18n`. Standardize to `@/i18n`.
- Icon import inconsistency
  - File: `src/components/NewGameSetupModal.tsx:6`
  - Issue: Uses `react-icons/hi` while most components use `react-icons/hi2`.
- Autosave over‑eager and broad deps
  - File: `src/components/HomePage.tsx:1168`
  - Issue: Autosave effect depends on large state and triggers often, potentially writing too frequently.
- History diff uses deep JSON stringify
  - File: `src/components/HomePage.tsx:220`
  - Issue: `JSON.stringify(nextState) === JSON.stringify(currentHistoryState)` is expensive and brittle to key order.
- Snapshot source for available players
  - Files: `src/components/HomePage.tsx:1070`, `src/components/HomePage.tsx:1142`
  - Issue: `availablePlayers` derived from `masterRosterQueryResultData || availablePlayers` may flip sources. Prefer one authoritative source.
- A11y on icon‑only buttons
  - File: `src/components/ControlBar.tsx`
  - Issue: Icon‑only controls rely on `title`. Add `aria-label` consistently.
- Tests out of sync with roster refactor
  - Issue: RosterSettings tests expect selection checkboxes. Current UI is master‑roster CRUD only.

Documentation Alignment (Completed)
- Fixed local‑only docs to use correct keys `TEAMS_INDEX_KEY` (`'soccerTeamsIndex'`) and `TEAM_ROSTERS_KEY` (`'soccerTeamRosters'`).
- Replaced brittle line numbers and absolute paths with repo‑relative references.
- Corrected NewGameSetupModal prompts to `newGameSetupModal.emptyTeamRosterPrompt` (team roster context) and clarified empty master roster guard is in `HomePage` new game entry.

Detailed Fix Plan (By Criticality)

P0 — Correctness, UX, and test health
- ✅ **Fix i18n initial language lookup** (COMPLETED)
  - Fixed `src/i18n.ts:18` to use `APP_SETTINGS_KEY` constant instead of hardcoded string
  - Outcome: Language now correctly respects saved settings, default 'fi' properly applied
- ✅ **Standardize icon imports to react-icons/hi2** (COMPLETED)
  - Updated `src/components/NewGameSetupModal.tsx:6` and `SeasonTournamentManagementModal.tsx`
  - Fixed `HiOutlineX` → `HiOutlineXMark` for Hi2 compatibility
  - Outcome: Consistent icon library usage across components
- ✅ **Add aria-labels to icon‑only buttons** (COMPLETED)
  - Enhanced `src/components/ControlBar.tsx` with comprehensive `aria-label` attributes
  - Added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative icons
  - Outcome: Significantly improved screen reader support and accessibility
- ✅ **Implement React Error Boundaries** (COMPLETED - P0 BONUS)
  - Created comprehensive `ErrorBoundary` component with TDD approach (6/6 tests passing)
  - Added error boundaries at app, screen, and component levels (SoccerField, PlayerBar)
  - Features: Custom fallbacks, error logging, recovery options, dev error details
  - Outcome: Prevents application crashes, better error recovery, enhanced UX
- Reduce autosave churn
  - `src/components/HomePage.tsx:1168`: debounce autosave (e.g., 500–1000ms) and narrow dependencies to fields that truly affect the persisted snapshot.
  - Outcome: Fewer writes, better responsiveness.
- Improve history change detection
  - `src/components/HomePage.tsx:220`: replace full JSON stringify with a shallow compare over specific tracked fields, or compute a stable hash over those fields.
  - Outcome: Less CPU and fewer redundant history entries.
- Update tests to reflect roster refactor
  - Adjust `src/components/RosterSettingsModal.test.tsx` and any related tests to verify master roster CRUD; move player selection tests to `GameSettingsModal`/`NewGameSetupModal` as appropriate.
  - Outcome: Green tests that match current UX.

P1 — Consistency, performance, structure
- Standardize `@/i18n` import usage
  - Normalize import paths in `StartScreen.tsx`, `HomePage.tsx`, and `I18nInitializer.tsx`.
- Stabilize availablePlayers snapshot source
  - In `HomePage.tsx` use the game’s `availablePlayers` as source of truth; refresh from master roster only when explicitly triggered by roster operations.
- Lazy‑load heavy modals and charts
  - Dynamically import heavy modals (`GameStatsModal`, `SeasonTournamentManagementModal`, etc.) using `next/dynamic`.
  - Outcome: Reduced initial bundle and faster first paint.
- Memoize heavy components and handlers
  - Wrap `SoccerField`, `PlayerBar`, `ControlBar` with `React.memo` where prop shapes are stable; use `useCallback`/`useMemo` for functions and derived data.
  - Outcome: Fewer re‑renders.

P2 — Quality of life and future‑proofing
- Refactor HomePage into smaller children + contexts
  - Extract timer/session/tactics concerns into providers or subcomponents for clarity and testability.
- Logging level control
  - Gate `logger.log` behind an env flag to reduce noise in production.
- Storage resilience (optional)
  - Add friendly messages for quota exceeded and a storage management surface; consider IndexedDB migration in the longer term.
- Accessibility sweep beyond ControlBar
  - Ensure all interactive elements have labels/roles and focus management across modals.

Implementation Notes
- i18n
  - `src/i18n.ts:17` currently reads `'appSettings'` directly; prefer `getAppSettings()` or reading `APP_SETTINGS_KEY` to preserve single source of truth.
- Alerts and prompts
  - Empty master roster guard is in `HomePage` when starting a new game; `NewGameSetupModal` handles empty selected team roster via `newGameSetupModal.emptyTeamRosterPrompt`.
- Teams
  - Name validation uses NFKC and case‑insensitive checks; roster ops guarded by `withRosterLock`.
- Stats adjustments
  - Adjustments merged with optional season/tournament inclusion; team filter respects legacy/no‑team adjustments.

## Strategic Architectural Roadmap

### Critical Scalability Issues (Post-Tactical Fixes)

While the above tactical improvements address immediate code quality issues, the application faces fundamental architectural challenges that require strategic planning:

#### **1. Monolithic Component Architecture**
**Issue**: HomePage.tsx contains ~3,317 lines of mixed concerns
- **Impact**: Poor maintainability, difficult testing, performance bottlenecks
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Blocks team productivity and feature development

**Recommended Architecture:**
```typescript
// Current: Monolithic HomePage
const HomePage = () => {
  // 3,317 lines of mixed game logic, UI state, data fetching
};

// Target: Modular Architecture
const HomePage = () => (
  <GameSessionProvider>
    <div className="app-container">
      <GameHeader />
      <PlayerManagement />
      <GameField />
      <GameControls />
      <ModalManager />
    </div>
  </GameSessionProvider>
);

// Context-based state management
const GameSessionProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const gameSession = useGameSessionReducer(initialState);
  const fieldState = useGameFieldState();
  const playerState = usePlayerState();
  
  return (
    <GameSessionContext.Provider value={gameSession}>
      <FieldStateContext.Provider value={fieldState}>
        <PlayerStateContext.Provider value={playerState}>
          {children}
        </PlayerStateContext.Provider>
      </FieldStateContext.Provider>
    </GameSessionContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

**Implementation Plan:**
- **Phase 1**: Extract GameHeader and ModalManager (low risk)
- **Phase 2**: Extract PlayerManagement with context
- **Phase 3**: Extract GameField and related state
- **Phase 4**: Extract GameControls and timer logic

#### **2. Accessibility Compliance Crisis**
**Current Status**: ~35% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Legal Risk**: Non-compliance with accessibility laws
- **User Impact**: Excludes users with disabilities entirely

**Critical Barriers:**
```typescript
// Current: Canvas with no accessibility
<canvas ref={canvasRef} onMouseDown={handleMouseDown} />

// Required: Accessible alternatives
<div role="application" aria-label="Soccer field tactical board">
  <canvas
    ref={canvasRef}
    role="img"
    aria-label={`Soccer field with ${players.length} players. Score: ${homeScore}-${awayScore}`}
    aria-describedby="field-description"
  />
  
  {/* Screen reader alternative */}
  <div id="field-description" className="sr-only">
    <h3>Field Layout</h3>
    <ul>
      {players.map(player => (
        <li key={player.id}>
          {player.name} at {getPositionDescription(player.relX, player.relY)}
          {player.isGoalie && " (Goalkeeper)"}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  {/* Live updates */}
  <div aria-live="polite" className="sr-only">
    {lastGameUpdate}
  </div>
</div>
```

**Accessibility Roadmap:**
- **Week 1-2**: Canvas alternatives and ARIA implementation
- **Week 3-4**: Keyboard navigation for all interactions
- **Week 5-6**: Focus management and live regions
- **Week 7-8**: Color contrast fixes and testing

#### **3. Performance Optimization Gaps**
**Current Issues**: Missing React.memo, no code splitting, inefficient re-renders

**Critical Optimizations:**
```typescript
// Component Memoization
const SoccerField = React.memo<SoccerFieldProps>(({ players, opponents, drawings }) => {
  // Implementation
}, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  return (
    prevProps.players.length === nextProps.players.length &&
    shallowEqual(prevProps.opponents, nextProps.opponents)
  );
});

// Code Splitting for Modals
const GameStatsModal = dynamic(() => import('./GameStatsModal'), {
  loading: () => <ModalSkeleton />,
  ssr: false
});

// State Optimization
const useOptimizedGameState = () => {
  const [playersOnField, setPlayersOnField] = useState([]);
  const [opponents, setOpponents] = useState([]);
  
  // Memoized derived state
  const fieldState = useMemo(() => ({
    players: playersOnField,
    opponents,
    hasGoalie: playersOnField.some(p => p.isGoalie)
  }), [playersOnField, opponents]);
  
  return fieldState;
};
```

**Performance Targets:**
- 30-40% bundle size reduction (code splitting)
- 50-70% fewer component re-renders (memoization)
- 25-35% faster Time to Interactive (lazy loading)
