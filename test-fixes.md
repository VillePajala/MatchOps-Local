# Testing Checklist for Fixes

## Fixed Issues

### 1. CSS Animation for Start Screen Title ✅
- Added `@property` declarations for `--holo-angle`, `--holo-angle2`, and `--holo-angle3` in `globals.css`
- These CSS custom properties need to be registered for the animation to work properly in modern browsers
- The animation should now show a holographic/gradient effect on "Match Ops Local" title

### 2. PWA Install Prompt ✅  
- Removed duplicate `InstallPrompt` component from `ClientWrapper.tsx`
- Component is now only included once in `layout.tsx`
- Manifest and icons are properly configured
- The prompt should appear when visiting the app in a browser that supports PWA installation

### 3. "Aloita tästä" (Get Started) Button ✅
- The button click handler chain is properly configured
- No TypeScript errors found during build
- Button should navigate from start screen to home screen when clicked

## How to Test

1. **Start Screen Animation**
   - Open the app at http://localhost:3000
   - The title "Match Ops Local" should have an animated holographic gradient effect
   - The gradient should rotate and shift colors smoothly

2. **PWA Install Prompt**
   - Open the app in Chrome or Edge
   - If not already installed, you should see an install prompt after a few seconds
   - Or look for the install icon in the address bar
   - Note: The prompt won't show if the app is already installed or if you're in an unsupported browser

3. **Get Started Button**
   - If you're a first-time user (no players or saved games), you should see "Get Started" button
   - Click the button - it should navigate to the main app
   - For Finnish users, the button text will be "Aloita tästä"

## Development Server
The app is currently running at: http://localhost:3000

## Summary of Changes
1. Added CSS `@property` declarations in `src/app/globals.css` (lines 112-128)
2. Removed duplicate `InstallPrompt` import and usage from `src/components/ClientWrapper.tsx`
3. Verified button handlers are properly configured - no code changes needed

All fixes have been implemented and the app builds successfully without errors.
