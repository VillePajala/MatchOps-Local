echo "Summary:"
echo "--------"
echo "Both features are implemented in the code:"
echo "✅ Deletion impact count shows affected games"
echo "✅ availablePlayers uses team roster from modal"
echo ""
echo "To test in the app:"
echo "1. Start dev server: npm run dev"
echo "2. Open http://localhost:3001"
echo "3. Create a team with players"
echo "4. Create games with that team"
echo "5. Try to delete the team - should show games count"
echo "6. Check saved games - availablePlayers should match team roster"
